It is a comprehensive curriculum that helps teachers achieve the very best program for children under three. If the interactions children have are nurturing, consistent, and loving, and the experiences they have are appropriately challenging, then infants, toddlers, and twos grow and flourish. In such an environment, children learn to trust and joyfully explore their surroundings, making discoveries and developing a sense of themselves as competent learners and caring human beings.</p><p>Diane Trister Dodge, founder and president of Teaching Strategies, Inc., is the author of numerous books, articles, and training materials on early childhood education.

But we may not recognize more subtle manifestations of anger, such as being uncomfortable with loose ends, acting impatiently, or being overly critical. That is anger, too. And, as is so often the case, angry folks don't seem to realize that the behavior causing them problems at home or at work actually stems from unrecognized and unresolved pain and emotional injuries from the past. Is all this negative emotion inevitable, or are there choices about how to respond, choices that can improve personal relationships as well as emotional health? <p><i>The Anger Trap</i> is a landmark book that strips away the myths and misconceptions about anger and reveals how you can learn to distinguish between healthy and unhealthy anger so that you may choose&#x2015;or help someone else to choose&#x2015;a better, more spiritually enlightened path. <i>The Anger Trap</i> examines the root causes of anger and can help you realize your patterns and break the destructive cycles of criticism, frustration, and irritation that hurt you and others around you.

I have long been intrigued in human affect&#x2014;the world of emotions and feelings&#x2014;and have spent many years investigating it: why and how we emote, feel, use feelings to construct our selves; how feelings assist or undermine our best intentions; why and how brains interact with the body to support such functions. I have new facts and interpretations to share on these matters.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> As for the idea, it is very simple: feelings have not been given the credit they deserve as motives, monitors, and negotiators of human cultural endeavors. Humans have distinguished themselves from all other beings by creating a spectacular collection of objects, practices, and ideas, collectively known as cultures. The collection includes the arts, philosophical inquiry, moral systems and religious beliefs, justice, governance, economic institutions, and technology and science. Why and how did this process begin? A frequent answer to this question invokes an important faculty of the human mind<i>&#x2014;</i>verbal language&#x2014;along with distinctive features such as intense sociality and superior intellect. For those who are biologically inclined the answer also includes natural selection operating at the level of genes. I have no doubt that intellect, sociality, and language have played key roles in the process, and it goes without saying that the organisms capable of cultural invention, along with the specific faculties used in the invention, are present in humans by the grace of natural selection and genetic transmission. The idea is that something else was required to jump-start the saga of human cultures. That something else was a motive. I am referring specifically to feelings, from pain and suffering to well-being and pleasure.<br> &nbsp;<br> Consider medicine, one of our most significant cultural enterprises. Medicine&#x2019;s combination of technology and science began as a response to the pain and suffering caused by diseases of every sort, from physical trauma and infections to cancers, contrasted with the very opposite of pain and suffering: well-being, pleasures, the prospect of thriving. Medicine did not begin as an intellectual sport meant to exercise one&#x2019;s wits over a diagnostic puzzle or a physiological mystery. It began as a consequence of specific feelings of patients and specific feelings of early physicians, including but not limited to the compassion that may be born of empathy. Those motives remain today. No reader will have failed to notice how visits to the dentist and surgical procedures have changed for the better in our own lifetime. The primary motive behind improvements such as efficient anesthetics and precise instrumentation is the management of feelings of discomfort. The activity of engineers and scientists plays a commendable role in this endeavor, but it is a motivated role. The profit motive of the drug and instrumentation industries also plays a significant part because the public does need to reduce its suffering and industries respond to that need. The pursuit of profit is fueled by varied yearnings, a desire for advancement, prestige, even greed, which are none other than feelings. It is not possible to comprehend the intense effort to develop cures for cancers or Alzheimer&#x2019;s disease without considering feelings as motives, monitors, and negotiators of the process. Nor is it possible to comprehend, for example, the less intense effort with which Western cultures have pursued cures for malaria in Africa or the management of drug addictions most everywhere without considering the respective web of motivating and inhibiting feelings. Language, sociality, knowledge, and reason are the primary inventors and executors of these complicated processes. But feelings get to motivate them, stay on to check the results, and help negotiate the necessary adjustments.<br> &nbsp;<br> The idea, in essence, is that cultural activity began and remains deeply embedded in feeling. The favorable <i>and </i>unfavorable interplay of feeling and reason must be acknowledged if we are to understand the conflicts and contradictions of the human condition<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> <b><i>2</i></b><br> &nbsp;<br> How did humans come to be at the same time sufferers, mendicants, celebrants of joy, philanthropists, artists and scientists, saints and criminals, benevolent masters of the earth and monsters intent on destroying it? The answer to this question requires the contributions of historians and sociologists, for certain, as well as those of artists, whose sensibilities often intuit the hidden patterns of the human drama, but the answer also requires the contributions of different branches of biology.<br> &nbsp;<br> As I considered how feelings could not only drive the first flush of cultures but remain integral to their evolution, I searched for a way to connect human life, as we know it today&#x2014;equipped with minds, feelings, consciousness, memory, language, complex sociality, and creative intelligence&#x2014;with early life, as early as 3.8 billion years ago. To establish the connection, I needed to suggest an order and a time line for the development and appearance of these critical faculties in the long history of evolution.<br> The actual order of appearance of biological structures and faculties that I uncovered violates traditional expectations and is as strange as the book title implies. In the history of life, events did not comply with the conventional notions that we humans have formed for how to build the beautiful instrument I like to call a cultural mind.<br> &nbsp;<br> Intending to tell a story about the substance and consequences of human feeling, I came to recognize that our ways of thinking about minds and cultures are out of tune with biological reality. When a living organism behaves intelligently and winningly in a social setting, we assume that the behavior results from foresight, deliberation, complexity, all with the help of a nervous system. It is now clear, however, that such behaviors could also have sprung from the bare and spare equipment of a single cell, namely, in a bacterium, at the dawn of the biosphere. &#x201c;Strange&#x201d; is too mild a word to describe this reality.<br> &nbsp;<br> We can envision an explanation that begins to accommodate the counterintuitive findings. The explanation draws on the mechanisms of life itself and on the conditions of its regulation, a collection of phenomena that is generally designated by a single word: <i>homeostasis</i>. Feelings are the mental expressions of homeostasis, while homeostasis, acting under the cover of feeling, is the functional thread that links early life-forms to the extraordinary partnership of bodies and nervous systems. That partnership is responsible for the emergence of conscious, feeling minds that are, in turn, responsible for what is most distinctive about humanity: cultures and civilizations. Feelings are at the center of the book, but they draw their powers from homeostasis.<br> &nbsp;<br> Connecting cultures to feeling and homeostasis strengthens their links to nature and deepens the humanization of the cultural process. Feelings and creative cultural minds were assembled by a long process in which genetic selection guided by homeostasis played a prominent role. Connecting cultures to feelings, homeostasis, and genetics counters the growing detachment of cultural ideas, practices, and objects from the process of life.<br> &nbsp;<br> It should be evident that the connections I am establishing do not&nbsp;diminish the autonomy that cultural phenomena acquire historically. I am not reducing cultural phenomena to their biological roots or attempting to have science explain all aspects of the cultural process. The sciences alone cannot illuminate the entirety of human experience without the light that comes from the arts and humanities.<br> &nbsp;<br> Discussions about the making of cultures often agonize over two conflicting accounts: one in which human behavior results from autonomous cultural phenomena, and another in which human behavior is the consequence of natural selection as conveyed by genes. But there is no need to favor one account over the other. Human behavior largely results from <i>both </i>influences in varying proportions and order.<br> &nbsp;<br> Curiously, discovering the roots of human cultures in nonhuman biology does not diminish the exceptional status of humans at all. The exceptional status of each human being derives from the unique significance of suffering and flourishing in the context of our remembrances of the past and of the memories we have constructed of the future we incessantly anticipate.<br> <i>&nbsp;</i><br> <i>&nbsp;</i><br> <i>&nbsp;</i><br> <b><i>3</i></b><br> &nbsp;<br> We humans are born storytellers, and we find it very satisfying to tell stories about how things began. We have reasonable success when the thing to be storied is a device or a relationship, love affairs and friendships being great themes for stories of origins. We are not so good and we are often wrong when we turn to the natural world. How did life begin? How did minds, feelings, or consciousness begin? When did social behaviors and cultures first appear? There is nothing easy about such an endeavor. When the laureate physicist Erwin Schr�dinger turned his attention to biology and wrote his classic book <i>What Is Life?, </i>it should be noted that he did not title it <i>The &#x201c;Origins&#x201d; of Life</i>. He recognized a fool&#x2019;s errand when he saw it.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> Still, the errand is irresistible. This book is dedicated to presenting some facts behind the making of minds that think, create narratives and meaning, remember the past and imagine the future; and to presenting some facts behind the machinery of feeling and consciousness responsible for the reciprocal connections among minds, the outside world, and its respective life. In their need to cope with the human heart in conflict, in their desire to reconcile the contradictions posed by suffering, fear, anger, and the pursuit of well-being, humans turned to wonder and awe and discovered music making, dancing, painting, and literature. They continued their efforts by creating the often beautiful and sometimes frayed epics that go by such names as religious belief, philosophical inquiry, and political governance. From cradle to grave, these were some of the ways in which the cultural mind addressed the human drama.</p><h2>English in Action 4 (English in Action, Second Edition)</h2><p>Fun, engaging, and action-packed! <br> Students learn better and are more motivated when they can put English into action!

He discusses the Church and the Papacy, the coming of Islam, and the rise and fall of the Frankish Empire. In his consideration of the High Middle Ages, Davis takes the reader from the Saxon Empire through to an examination of the European economy in the mid-thirteenth century, addressing the spread of monasticism, the papal reform, the crusades, and feudal monarchy.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The third edition, revised by R. I. Moore, leaves the text unaltered, but reflects the considerable growth in our knowledge of the period. New features include:</p> <p>�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A new Preface, outlining Davis's view of the importance and relevance of medieval history</p> <p>�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Postscripts to each part, introducing the most important new interpretations of the period to have emerged since the book was written, and showing how Davis's views relate to them</p> <p>�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; New maps and illustrations</p> <p>�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Updated reading lists</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Combining a strong narrative history of the period with an introduction to diverse historical perspectives, this book is essential reading for all students of medieval history.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The late <b>R.

It is the last installment of Shigekuni Honda&#x2019;s pursuit of the successive reincarnations of his childhood friend Kiyoaki Matsugae.<br> &nbsp;<br> It is the late 1960s and Honda, now an aged and wealthy man, once more encounters a person he believes to be a reincarnation of his friend, Kiyoaki &#x2014; this time restored to life as a teenage orphan, T&#x14d;ru. Adopting the boy as his heir, Honda quickly finds that T&#x14d;ru is a force to be reckoned with. The final novel of this celebrated tetralogy weaves together the dominant themes of the previous three novels in the series: the decay of Japan&#x2019;s courtly tradition; the essence and value of Buddhist philosophy and aesthetics; and, underlying all, Mishima&#x2019;s apocalyptic vision of the modern era.</p><p>The dramatic climax of the SEA OF FERTILITY, bringing together the dominant themes of the three previous novels; the decay of Japan&#39;s courtly tradition and samurai ideal, and the essence and value of Buddhist philosophy.<b>Yukio Mishima</b> was born in Tokyo in 1925. He graduated from Tokyo Imperial University&#x2019;s School of Jurisprudence in 1947. His first published book, <i>The Forest in Full Bloom</i>, appeared in 1944 and he established himself as a major author with <i>Confessions of a Mask </i>(1949). From then until his death he continued to publish novels, short stories, and plays each year. His crowning achievement, <i>The Sea of Fertility</i> tetralogy&#x2014;which contains the novels <i>Spring Snow</i> (1969), <i>Runaway Horses</i> (1969), <i>The Temple of Dawn</i> (1970), and <i>The Decay of the Angel </i>(1971)&#x2014;is considered one of the definitive works of twentieth century Japanese fiction.

Beginning with a discussion of characteristics of the plant kingdom, this logically organized volume presents plantlike nonplants (fungi, lichens, algae) and then proceeds up the phyla: liverworts and mosses; horsetails, club mosses and ferns; gymnosperms and angiosperms. Plant parts and processes (roots, stems, leaves, flowers, fruits, pollination, photosynthesis) are then discussed in greater detail; information on classification concludes the book. Though the text is technical, almost every aspect is illustrated, and each term and topic is detailed in the index. Visually beautiful and unusually complete: an excellent choice for reference and circulation, made especially accessible by index's more than 3,000 entries. (Nonfiction. 10+) -- <i>Copyright �1992, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>Grade 6 Up-- ``Visual'' is the operative word. Lush illustrations are organized under categories to explain types, structures, and functions of spe cies within the plant world. Full-color displays cover topics such as fungi and lichens, gymno sperms, roots, leaves, fertilization, dryland plants, etc. Each section begins with a general overview; extending and complementing that basic description are carefully labelled illustra tions and photographs. The specialized botani cal vocabulary is not watered down, and the photographs effectively illustrate each term. This is not a dictionary for novices, since the explanations are not extensive enough to in form fully the uninitiated and there is no glos sary. Still, the striking illustrations could easily stand alone for browsers. --Steve Matthews, Foxcroft School, Middleburg, VA<br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Children&#39;s Literature, Briefly (6th Edition)</h2><p><p> <b>A concise, engaging, practical overview of children&#x2019;s books that keeps the focus on the books themselves, </b>this brief introduction to children&#x2019;s literature genres leaves time to actually <i>read</i> children&#x2019;s books.

A definitive guide to the peoples, lands, journeys, and their histories. Maps and diagrams.</p><p>The publishing world is full of Tolkien spinoff products, some trivial and ephemeral--but some, like this thoroughly researched atlas, are genuinely classy. Karen Wynn Fonstad is a qualified geographer and cartographer who first mapped Middle-Earth in 1981 and has since added much new detail based on those endless volumes of drafts, abandoned passages, alternative versions, and laundry lists published since Tolkien's death. She fills in gaps and details in the familiar Third Age maps from <i>The Hobbit</i> and <i>The Lord of the Rings</i>, goes back in time to map Middle-Earth's First and Second Ages, and reconstructs the route and timescale of every important journey in the stories. There are local maps of key places like the Mines of Moria, Lothlorien, Isengard, Minas Tirth, the Tower of Cirith Ungol, and the volcanic Mount Doom. War maps cover the saga's notable battles, up to the hopeless last stand at Mordor gate and the tiny later skirmish known in Shire records as the Battle of Bywater. Thematic maps show Middle-Earth's distribution of climate, geological features, vegetation, people, and (most importantly to Tolkien) languages.... It's all done tremendously seriously and would make a fine gift for enthusiastic Tolkien fans, except that they'll have bought it already. <i>--David Langford, Amazon.co.uk</i>Karen Wynn Fonstad, the author or The Atlas of Pern, The Forgotten Realms Atlas and other guides to fantasy worlds, is a noted cartographer.

A tenth of the British exchequer's total revenue derived from customs receipts on the Company's UK imports; its armed forces exceeded those of most sovereign states. Without it there would have been no British India and no British Empire.</p><p>John Keay reconstructs this epic of expansionist endeavour from the journals and records of the Company's employees: the first experimental voyages to the East; the earliest, often disastrous, settlements; the later, often inglorious, wars; and the often venal administrations.

His search will lead him to discover a coded and ingenious puzzle that conceals a disturbing secret from the founding of our nation. It is a secret, Beecher soon discovers, that some believe is worth killing for.<br><br>Gripping, fast-paced, and filled with the fascinating historical detail for which he is famous,<em> The Inner Circle</em> is a thrilling novel that once again proves Brad Meltzer as a brilliant author writing at the height of his craft.</p><p>Brad Meltzer is the #1 <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of <i>The Inner Circle</i>, <i>The Book of Fate</i>, and seven other bestselling thrillers.

You can also see what he's doing right now at Facebook.com/BradMeltzer and on Twitter @bradmeltzer.<br>In this political thriller with historical-conspiracy overtones (or perhaps it&#x2019;s the other way around), Meltzer creates his most engaging protagonist in years. Beecher White is an archivist with the National Archives, who stumbles upon an old book hidden away in a room used exclusively by the president. But did the president know that the book (a spelling dictionary that once belonged to George Washington) was there? And&#x2014;almost impossible for Beecher to imagine&#x2014;could it be that the president or someone close to him is willing to kill to regain possession of the book? Meltzer teams Beecher with an equally strong character, Clementine Kaye, a woman from the archivist&#x2019;s past whose estranged father is, perhaps not coincidentally, the man who tried to kill the current president&#x2019;s predecessor. Meltzer expertly develops the story, throwing in twists and turns at appropriate intervals, and he does an excellent job of putting us in Beecher&#x2019;s corner and making us care about what happens to him. The story has a surprising and satisfying conclusion, and Meltzer leaves the door wide open for a sequel. --David Pitt</p><h2>The Brewmaster&#39;s Table</h2><p>A tribute to traditional beer making by the head of the Brooklyn Brewery notes its accessibility and how its varied flavors and versatility make it compatible with a wide range of foods, in a guide that also offers an illustrated tour of top international breweries.</p><p>"A scholarly and readable book." -- Los Angeles Times<br><br>"Preached by the poet warrior of real beer and real food...

With an idiosyncratic and at times iconoclastic take on the charms and foibles of the Church fathers, Carr�re ferries readers through his &#x201c;doors&#x201d; into the biblical narrative. Once inside, he follows the ragtag group of early Christians through the tumultuous days of the faith&#x2019;s founding.</p><p>Shouldering biblical scholarship like a camcorder, Carr�re re-creates the climate of the New Testament with the acumen of a seasoned storyteller, intertwining his own account of reckoning with the central tenets of the faith with the lives of the first Christians. Carr�re puts himself in the shoes of Saint Paul and above all Saint Luke, charting Luke&#x2019;s encounter with the marginal Jewish sect that eventually became Christianity, and retracing his investigation of its founder, an obscure religious freak who died under notorious circumstances.</p><p>Boldly blending scholarship with speculation, memoir with journalistic muckraking, Carr�re sets out on a headlong chase through the latter part of the Bible, drawing out protagonists who believed they were caught up in the most important events of their time. An expansive and clever meditation on belief, <i>The Kingdom</i> chronicles the advent of a religion, and the ongoing quest to find a place within it.</p></p><p><p><b>Emmanuel Carr�re</b>, born in Paris in 1957, is a writer, scriptwriter, and film producer.

Profoundly intimate, historically and philosophically serious but able to cast compulsive narrative spells, Carr�re&#x2019;s books are hybrids, marrying deep reporting to scholarly explorations of theology, philosophy, psychology, personal history and historiography . . . Carr�re has managed to write one masterpiece after another . . . The need to understand the role you have in the larger human story is at the heart of this beautiful, difficult book.

What makes <i>The Kingdom</i> so engrossing is this element of personal struggle, our sense that the agnostic author is looking over his shoulder at the armies of faith, as they pursue him to the wall of rationality.&#x201d; &#x2015;<b>James Wood, <i>The New Yorker</i></b></p><p>"To open the pages of this book is to fall into a world of speculation, memoir, history, and belief and disbelief in untidy measures. . . . a masterwork that takes readers into the heart of Christianity&#x2019;s first days, as well into the depths of the author&#x2019;s psyche. . . .

Ken Kesey died on November 10, 2001.After 25 years, a new novel from Kesey--a brilliant, funny, heartening tale of the power of love to stomp out evil in the last decent town on earth--proves that the heroic old Trickster can still pitch a fastball. Just after the turn of the millennium, Isaak Sallas, a.k.a ``the Bakatcha Bandit,'' a legendary environmental warrior from the ``Nasty Nineties,'' wakes up in his antique trailer to confront a couple of unwelcome omens from the end of the world. The most deadly sign is the silvery albino Nick Levertov, the bad-seed son of Alice (``the Angry Aleut''), battering the hell out of blowzy Louise Loop. The next day, watching a huge silver movie-company yacht sail into the harbor with Levertov aboard, Sallas realizes that Levertov has come back to Kuinak, Alaska, to settle a score of grievances. A couple of decades before, Sallas, once a CIA flier who won the Navy Cross, had to bear the death of his baby daughter- -a death caused by his own exposure to pesticides. The tragedy transformed him absolutely. The next day, he used his pesticide plane to drop a fragrant load on an upper-middle-class crowd at a California county fair: right ``Bakatcha.'' His fire had burned out long since, he now thinks. He'd hoped to live in peaceful obscurity in this last unpolluted backwater, fishing with the jolly Brit skipper Carmody and his Rasta sidekick Greer. Now, however, with Levertov buying up and corrupting the town with wads of movie money and piles of a designer drug called ``Scoot,'' Sallas discovers that he has the stuff--the love and faith--to drive evil out of town: ``Dolls were being set up, and being knocked down. The situation was in progress, and in dedicated lock; it couldn't be blinked and it couldn't be ducked.'' A wonderful tale for the times, proving Kesey is ``Bakacha'' after all these years. -- <i>Copyright �1992, Kirkus Associates, LP.

He teaches at the University of California at Berkeley.The Land of Little Rain East <br><br>away from the Sierras, south from Panamint and Amargosa, east and south many an uncounted mile, is the Country of Lost Borders.<br><br>Ute, Paiute, Mojave, and Shoshone inhabit its frontiers, and as far into the heart of it as a man dare go. Not the law, but the land sets the limit. Desert is the name it wears upon the maps, but the Indian&#x2019;s is the better word. Desert is a loose term to indicate land that supports no man; whether the land can be bitted and broken to that purpose is not proven. Void of life it never is, however dry the air and villainous the soil.<br><br>This is the nature of that country. There are hills, rounded, blunt, burned, squeezed up out of chaos, chrome and vermilion painted, aspiring to the snow-line. Between the hills lie high level-looking plains full of intolerable sun glare, or narrow valleys drowned in a blue haze. The hill surface is streaked with ash drift and black, unweathered lava flows. After rains water accumulates in the hollows of small closed valleys, and, evaporating, leaves hard dry levels of pure desertness that get the local name of dry lakes. Where the mountains are steep and the rains heavy, the pool is never quite dry, but dark and bitter, rimmed about with the efflorescence of alkaline deposits. A thin crust of it lies along the marsh over the vegetating area, which has neither beauty nor freshness. In the broad wastes open to the wind the sand drifts in hummocks about the stubby shrubs, and between them the soil shows saline traces. The sculpture of the hills here is more wind than water work, though the quick storms do sometimes scar them past many a year&#x2019;s redeeming. In all the western desert edges there are essays in miniature at the famed, terrible Grand Ca�on, to which, if you keep on long enough in this country, you will come at last.<br><br>Since this is a hill country one expects to find springs, but not to depend upon them; for when found they are often brackish and unwholesome, or maddening, slow dribbles in a thirsty soil. Here you find the hot sink of Death Valley, or high rolling districts where the air has always a tang of frost. Here are the long heavy winds and breathless calms on the tilted mesas where dust devils dance, whirling up into a wide, pale sky. Here you have no rain when all the earth cries for it, or quick downpours called cloud-bursts for violence. A land of lost rivers, with little in it to love; yet a land that once visited must be come back to inevitably. If it were not so there would be little told of it.<br><br>This is the country of three seasons. From June on to Novem- ber it lies hot, still, and unbearable, sick with violent unrelieving storms; then on until April, chill, quiescent, drinking its scant rain and scanter snows; from April to the hot season again, blossoming, radiant, and seductive. These months are only approximate; later or earlier the rain-laden wind may drift up the water gate of the Colorado from the Gulf, and the land sets its seasons by the rain.<br><br>The desert floras shame us with their cheerful adaptations to the seasonal limitations. Their whole duty is to flower and fruit, and they do it hardly, or with tropical luxuriance, as the rain admits. It is recorded in the report of the Death Valley expedition that after a year of abundant rains, on the Colorado desert was found a specimen of Amaranthus ten feet high. A year later the same species in the same place matured in the drought at four inches. One hopes the land may breed like qualities in her human offspring, not tritely to &#x201c;try,&#x201d; but to do. Seldom does the desert herb attain the full stature of the type. Extreme aridity and extreme altitude have the same dwarfing effect, so that we find in the high Sierras and in Death Valley related species in miniature that reach a comely growth in mean temperatures. Very fertile are the desert plants in expedients to prevent evaporation, turning their foliage edgewise toward the sun, growing silky hairs, exuding viscid gum. The wind, which has a long sweep, harries and helps them. It rolls up dunes about the stocky stems, encompassing and protective, and above the dunes, which may be, as with the mesquite, three times as high as a man, the blossoming twigs flourish and bear fruit.<br><br>There are many areas in the desert where drinkable water lies within a few feet of the surface, indicated by the mesquite and the bunch grass (Sporobolus airoides). It is this nearness of unimagined help that makes the tragedy of desert deaths. It is related that the final breakdown of that hapless party that gave Death Valley its forbidding name occurred in a locality where shallow wells would have saved them. But how were they to know that? Properly equipped it is possible to go safely across that ghastly sink, yet every year it takes its toll of death, and yet men find there sun-dried mummies, of whom no trace or recollection is preserved. To underestimate one&#x2019;s thirst, to pass a given landmark to the right or left, to find a dry spring where one looked for running water&#x2014;there is no help for any of these things.<br><br>Along springs and sunken watercourses one is surprised to find such water-loving plants as grow widely in moist ground, but the true desert breeds its own kind, each in its particular habitat. The angle of the slope, the frontage of a hill, the structure of the soil determines the plant. South-looking hills are nearly bare, and the lower tree-line higher here by a thousand feet. Ca�ons running east and west will have one wall naked and one clothed. Around dry lakes and marshes the herbage preserves a set and orderly arrangement. Most species have well-defined areas of growth, the best index the voiceless land can give the traveler of his whereabouts.<br><br>If you have any doubt about it, know that the desert begins with the creosote. This immortal shrub spreads down into Death Valley and up to the lower timber-line, odorous and medicinal as you might guess from the name, wandlike, with shining fretted foliage. Its vivid green is grateful to the eye in a wilderness of gray and greenish white shrubs. In the spring it exudes a resinous gum which the Indians of those parts know how to use with pulverized rock for cementing arrow points to shafts. Trust Indians not to miss any virtues of the plant world!<br><br>Nothing the desert produces expresses it better than the unhappy growth of the tree yuccas. Tormented, thin forests of it stalk drearily in the high mesas, particularly in that triangular slip that fans out eastward from the meeting of the Sierras and coastwise hills where the first swings across the southern end of the San Joaquin Valley. The yucca bristles with bayonet-pointed leaves, dull green, growing shaggy with age, tipped with panicles of fetid, greenish bloom. After death, which is slow, the ghostly hollow network of its woody skeleton, with hardly power to rot, makes the moonlight fearful. Before the yucca has come to flower, while yet its bloom is a creamy cone-shaped bud of the size of a small cabbage, full of sugary sap, the Indians twist it deftly out of its fence of daggers and roast it for their own delectation. So it is that in those parts where man inhabits one sees young plants of Yucca arborensis infrequently. Other yuccas, cacti, low herbs, a thousand sorts, one finds journeying east from the coastwise hills. There is neither poverty of soil nor species to account for the sparseness of desert growth, but simply that each plant requires more room. So much earth must be pre�mpted to extract so much moisture. The real struggle for existence, the real brain of the plant, is underground; above there is room for a rounded perfect growth. In Death Valley, reputed the very core of desolation, are nearly two hundred identified species.<br><br>Above the lower tree-line, which is also the snow-line, mapped out abruptly by the sun, one finds spreading growth of pi�on, juniper, branched nearly to the ground, lilac and sage, and scattering white pines.<br><br>There is no special preponderance of self-fertilized or wind-fertilized plants, but everywhere the demand for and evidence of insect life. Now where there are seeds and insects there will be birds and small mammals, and where these are, will come the slinking, sharp-toothed kind that prey on them. Go as far as you dare in the heart of a lonely land, you cannot go so far that life and death are not before you. Painted lizards slip in and out of rock crevices, and pant on the white hot sands. Birds, hummingbirds even, nest in the cactus scrub; woodpeckers befriend the demoniac yuccas; out of the stark, treeless waste rings the music of the night-singing mockingbird. If it be summer and the sun well down, there will be a burrowing owl to call. Strange, furry, tricksy things dart across the open places, or sit motionless in the conning towers of the creosote. The poet may have &#x201c;named all the birds without a gun,&#x201d; but not the fairy-footed, ground-inhabiting, furtive, small folk of the rainless regions. They are too many and too swift; how many you would not believe without seeing the footprint tracings in the sand. They are nearly all night workers, finding the days too hot and white. In mid-desert where there are no cattle, there are no birds of carrion, but if you go far in that direction the chances are that you will find yourself shadowed by their tilted wings. Nothing so large as a man can move unspied upon in that country, and they know well how the land deals with strangers. There are hints to be had here of the way in which a land forces new habits on its dwellers. The quick increase of suns at the end of spring sometimes overtakes birds in their nesting and effects a reversal of the ordinary manner of incubation. It becomes necessary to keep eggs cool rather than warm. One hot, stifling spring in the Little Antelope I had occa- sion to pass and repass frequently the nest of a pair of meadowlarks, located unhappily in the shelter of a very slender weed. I never caught them sitting except near night, but at midday they stood, or drooped above it, half fainting with pitifully parted bills, between their treasure and the sun. Sometimes both of them together with wings spread and half lifted continued a spot of shade in a temperature that constrained me at last in a fellow feeling to spare them a bit of canvas for permanent shelter. There was a fence in that country shutting in a cattle range, and along its fifteen miles of posts one could be sure of finding a bird or two in every strip of shadow; sometimes the sparrow and the hawk, with wings trailed and beaks parted, drooping in the white truce of noon.<br><br>If one is inclined to wonder at first how so many dwellers came to be in the loneliest land that ever came out of God&#x2019;s hands, what they do there and why stay, one does not wonder so much after having lived there. None other than this long brown land lays such a hold on the affections. The rainbow hills, the tender bluish mists, the luminous radiance of the spring, have the lotus charm. They trick the sense of time, so that once inhabiting there you always mean to go away without quite realizing that you have not done it. Men who have lived there, miners and cattle-men, will tell you this, not so fluently, but emphatically, cursing the land and going back to it. For one thing there is the divinest, cleanest air to be breathed anywhere in God&#x2019;s world. Some day the world will understand that, and the little oases on the windy tops of hills will harbor for healing its ailing, house-weary broods. There is promise there of great wealth in ores and earths, which is no wealth by reason of being so far removed from water and workable conditions, but men are bewitched by it and tempted to try the impossible.<br><br>You should hear Salty Williams tell how he used to drive eighteen and twenty-mule teams from the borax marsh to Mojave, ninety miles, with the trail wagon full of water barrels. Hot days the mules would go so mad for drink that the clank of the water bucket set them into an uproar of hideous, maimed noises, and a tangle of harness chains, while Salty would sit on the high seat with the sun glare heavy in his eyes, dealing out curses of pacification in a level, uninterested voice until the clamor fell off from sheer exhaustion. There was a line of shallow graves along that road; they used to count on dropping a man or two of every new gang of coolies brought out in the hot season. But when he lost his swamper, smitten without warning at the noon halt, Salty quit his job; he said it was &#x201c;too durn hot.&#x201d; The swamper he buried by the way with stones upon him to keep the coyotes from digging him up, and seven years later I read the penciled lines on the pine headboard, still bright and unweathered.<br><br>But before that, driving up on the Mojave stage, I met Salty again crossing Indian Wells, his face from the high seat, tanned and ruddy as a harvest moon, looming through the golden dust above his eighteen mules. The land had called him.<br><br>The palpable sense of mystery in the desert air breeds fables, chiefly of lost treasure. Somewhere within its stark borders, if one believes report, is a hill strewn with nuggets; one seamed with virgin silver; an old clayey water-bed where Indians scooped up earth to make cooking pots and shaped them reeking with grains of pure gold. Old miners drifting about the desert edges, weathered into the semblance of the tawny hills, will tell you tales like these convincingly. After a little sojourn in that land you will believe them on their own account. It is a question whether it is not better to be bitten by the little horned snake of the desert that goes sidewise and strikes without coiling, than by the tradition of a lost mine.<br><br>And yet&#x2014;and yet&#x2014;is it not perhaps to satisfy expectation that one falls into the tragic key in writing of desertness? The more you wish of it the more you get, and in the mean time lose much of pleasantness. In that country which begins at the foot of the east slope of the Sierras and spreads out by less and less lofty hill ranges toward the Great Basin, it is possible to live with great zest, to have red blood and delicate joys, to pass and repass about one&#x2019;s daily performance an area that would make an Atlantic seaboard State, and that with no peril, and, according to our way of thought, no particular difficulty. At any rate, it was not people who went into the desert merely to write it up who invented the fabled Hassaympa, of whose waters, if any drink, they can no more see fact as naked fact, but all radiant with the color of romance. I, who must have drunk of it in my twice seven years&#x2019; wanderings, am assured that it is worth while.<br><br>For all the toll the desert takes of a man it gives compensations, deep breaths, deep sleep, and the communion of the stars. It comes upon one with new force in the pauses of the night that the Chaldeans were a desert-bred people. It is hard to escape the sense of mastery as the stars move in the wide clear heavens to risings and settings unobscured. They look large and near and palpitant; as if they moved on some stately service not needful to declare. Wheeling to their stations in the sky, they make the poor world-fret of no account. Of no account you who lie out there watching, nor the lean coyote that stands off in the scrub from you and howls and howls.</p><h2>Demian: The Story of Emil Sinclair&#39;s Youth</h2><p>One of the great writers of the twentieth century tells the dramatic story of a young man's awakening to selfhood.

It begins with a simple question: Why do we invest so much of our energy into the citation of sources? Followed by the intriguing answer: Because all sources are not created equal. As a citation guide, Evidence Explained is built on this simple question and answer. According to the author, there are no historical resources we can trust at face value. Records simply offer evidence, and their assertions may or may not be true. To decide what actually happened, we must understand those records. To analyze that evidence and judge what to believe, we also need particular facts about those records. Thus, Evidence Explained has two principal uses: it provides citation models for most historical sources especially original materials not covered by classic citation guides such as The Chicago Manual of Style. Beyond that it can help us understand each type of record and identify each in such detail that we and our readers will know not only where to go to find our source, but, equally important, the nature of that source so that the evidence can be better interpreted and the accuracy of our conclusions properly appraised. Highlights Covers all contemporary and electronic sources not discussed in traditional style manuals, including digital, audio, and video sources Explains citation principals and includes more than 1,000 citation models for virtually every source type Shows readers where to go to find their sources and how to describe them and evaluate them Teaches readers to separate facts from assertions and theory from proof in the evaluation of evidence. Most importantly, Evidence Explained discusses source citations for every known class of records, including microfilm and microfiche, and records created by the new digital media: Websites Blogs Digital books and journals DVDs CDs Audio files Podcasts Everyone Needs This Book -Carry it around and consult it for the correct citation of any source you come across -Keep it constantly at your side to help you identify sources -Use it to evaluate digital and Internet sources -Make it your standard for citing sources and evaluating evidence in your day-to-day research</p><p>Elizabeth Shown Mills is a historical writer with decades of research experience in public and private records of many Western nations.

Get Some Experience. Want Experience? Get a Job, 1978) on the most controversial UFO case in US history: the purported crash of a saucer, complete with aliens, on July 3, 1947, near Corona, New Mexico. The ostensible crash and subsequent government coverup have received much attention over the years, notably in a 1980 bestseller by Charles Berlitz (Roswell Incident) and a novel by Whitley Strieber (Majestic, 1989). What do Friedman and Berliner add to the tale? High melodrama, with tinges of 1950's sci-fi and Red-menace movies (``Man had just come face to face with beings from another world,'' the authors declaim, said encounter being buried by ``brilliant covering-up by the entire American government''). Lots of reports from first- and second-hand witnesses, who remember seeing alien corpses and handling bits of mysterious, hieroglyphic-covered metallic foil. An intriguing theory of a second crash several miles away. A pointless description of the crash site today. Attempts to shore up ``documents'' about the crash (the so-called ``Majestic-12'' papers) that most UFO researchers reject as fakes. And last but not least, a subtext of embarrassing infighting among UFO researchers, who will win no awards for scholarly detachment. No great shakes, but a decent updating of Berlitz's report. Corona, New Mexico, still awaits its Schliemann, or at least its Jim Garrison; ufology still awaits its Homer. (Photographs--not seen.) -- <i>Copyright �1992, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>Oldtime UFO lecturer Friedman and aviation author Berliner have written the third book in a dozen years about a U.S. weather balloon that fell to earth in New Mexico in July 1947. Charles Berlitz and William L. Moore's The Roswell Incident ( LJ 9/15/80) turns the balloon into a crashed spaceship with four alien beings aboard. Kevin Randle and Don R. Shmitt's UFO Crash at Roswell (Avon, 1991) increases the number to at least six but adds little else to the myth. The present book, a clone of the other two, moves the crash to Corona, a small town 90 miles northwest of Roswell and adds a chapter on "MJ-12," an alleged super-duper top-secret government investigatory and cover-up operation, formed in 1952 and continuing today. The book is filled with "could be's" which become "probably's" that turn into "must have been's." There are plenty of interviews with children, nephews, neighbors, and others who were among the original "witnesses" of the debris (most of whom are dead), but nothing very believable is offered. Perhaps Friedman and Berliner think that if you repeat a fairy tale often enough, it becomes true. Skip this.<br><i>- Dave Summers, Holly Twp.

Or the day of His baptism? What would it have been like to sit at His feet while He taught the people the sinners, the children, the apostles? What would the sky have looked like over Gethsemane? Photographer Mark Mabry re-creates authentic, meridian-of-time scenes using both full-color and black-and-white photographs. This first-of-a-kind book showcases twenty-five scenes of the life of Christ. From the Nativity to His miracles to His death and resurrection, these unique portrayals, accompanied by New Testament scripture, offer a powerful witness of the Lord Jesus Christ. Included in the book are behind-the-scenes author notes, providing readers with an intimate glimpse into the making of each photograph. Stunning and sacred, Reflections of Christ is an ideal coffee-table book that is filled with images that millions of people have already experienced and grown to love. It is a book that Christian families will be proud to have in their homes.</p><p>Mark Mabry studied art photography at the Brooks Institute of Photography at Santa Barbara, California. He owns a photography studio and is a professional photographer focusing on family and commercial portraiture. Reflections of Christ is his first book. Mark and his wife, Tara, and their three young children live in Mesa, Arizona.Reflections of Christ is a coffee table book containing 30 outstanding pictures of Jesus Christ- photographs by Mark Mabry depicting the life of Christ during the New Testament-era. Scenes include the Nativity, Christ&#39;s baptism, miracles, Atonement, death, and resurrection. Mark Mabry and his crew first started shooting these amazing pictures of Jesus to promote the Mesa Arizona Temple&#39;s Easter Pageant. The work and dramatic images of the life of Christ turned into an exhibit that is currently touring Canada and the US. A slide show, CD of music that plays in the exhibit, and a behind-the-scenes DVD were also created. Pictures of Jesus are a Photographic Masterpiece Reflections of Christ, by Mark Mabry and the Reflections Media Group, is a photographic milestone and masterpiece. Mabry and his team undertook the substantial endeavor of recreating the major events in the life of Jesus Christ and portraying them in photographs. While we may have seen similar attempts in film and various other art forms, this series of still pictures offers a new level of exceptional artistry. The opening photograph in the book, titled Angels, is probably the most complex and spectacular, making the viewer eager to study all the details. To create this picture, Mabry photographed individual actors in costume as each one jumped on a trampoline. Then he digitally compiled and layered them atop a nighttime sky to which was added one of NASA s Universe pictures taken by the Hubble Telescope. The result, which would never have been possible without current digital technology, is impressive. Pictures of Jesus Christ&#39;s Ministry However, it is Mabry s less complex images throughout the book which seem the most compelling: Christ healing a desperate blind man; the woman taken in adultery who is backed by the jeweled hands of her accusers as they hold or drop their rocks; the beautifully displayed symbolism of the ten virgins half of them with lit lamps, others in shadow; the betrayal by Judas told in a hopeless expression as he clutches his coins; the anguished Savior in Gethsemane with a storm-filled sky in the background; and, of course, heart-rending details of the crucifixion. And it is the simplistic perfection of the resurrected Christ, and the striking ascension piece with the look of a painting, which complete this moving work. It is important to add here that Mark Mabry s photographic genius was aided by an excellent cast whose expressions bring the viewer into the emotions of each scene. Most notable was Robert Allen, who portrayed Christ. Others also brought their unspoken testimonies to the still shots, and some of their touching comments are included in the notations at the back of the book. Additionally, an explanation in the forward of how Mabry spiritually prepared himself for this undertaking, and his later comments about the many circumstances which seemed to miraculously come together for the photo shoots, are inspirational. Where is the Calling of the Twelve Apostles? Regardless, the photographs, supplemented with scriptural references, are works of art. At a time when Christmas has become more about the world than Christ too materialistic with its glitz and forced merchandising Reflections of Christ is a visual gift that could help any family draw closer to the Savior and better understand his life s mission. The behind-the-scenes DVD is fascinating and the music on the CD is beautiful but I prefer to focus on the pictures of Jesus in Reflections of Christ they are truly amazing, giving this coffee table book a full five stars. --About.com</p><h2>The Fall of Paris: The Siege and the Commune 1870-71</h2><p>Alistair Horne's The Fall of Paris: The Siege and the Commune, 1870-71 is the first book of Alistair Horne's trilogy, which includes The Price of Glory and To Lose a Battle and tells the story of the great crises of the rivalry between France and Germany. The collapse of France in 1870 had an overwhelming impact - on Paris, on France and on the rest of the world. People everywhere saw Paris as the centre of Europe and the hub of culture, fashion and invention. But suddenly France, not least to the disbelief of her own citizens, was gripped in the vice of the Prussian armies and forced to surrender on humiliating terms. Almost immediately Paris was convulsed by the savage self-destruction of the newly formed Socialist government, the Commune. In this brilliant study of the Siege of Paris and its aftermath, Alistair Horne researches first-hand accounts left by official observers, private diarists and letter-writers to evoke the high drama of those ten tumultuous months and the spiritual and physical agony that Paris and the Parisians suffered as they lost the Franco-Prussian war.

Watch and find out as Eugene Drucker, a member of the world&#x2013;renowned Emerson String Quartet, commissions Sam Zygmuntowicz, a Brooklyn craftsman, to make him a new violin. As he tells this extraordinary story, journalist John Marchese shares the rich lore of this beloved instrument and illuminates an art that has barely changed since the Renaissance. </p><p> Marchese takes readers from start to finish as Zygmuntowicz builds the violin, from the first selection of the wood, to the cutting of the back and belly, through the carving of the scroll and the fingerboard, to the placement of the sound peg. Though much of the story takes place in the craftsman's museum&#x2013;like Brooklyn workshop, there are side trips across the river to the rehearsal rooms of Carnegie Hall and Lincoln center, and across the world. Stops on the itinerary include Cremona, Italy, the magical city where Antonio Stradivari (and a few of his contemporaries) achieved a level of violin&#x2013;making perfection that has endured for centuries, as well as points in France and Germany integral to the history of the violin.</p><p> A stunning work of narrative nonfiction that's also a finely crafted, loving homage to the instrument that most closely approximates the human voice.</p></p><p><p>A musician and award-winning journalist, John Marchese is the author of <em>Renovations: A Father and Son Rebuild a House and Rediscover Each Other</em>. He lives in New York City and in New York's Catskill Mountain region.</p>Celebrated Brooklyn violin-maker Sam Zygmuntowicz recently accepted a challenging commission from violinist Eugene Drucker of the Emerson String Quartet: to make a new violin that would equal Drucker's beloved Stradivarius. Marchese (<i>Renovations: A Father and Son Rebuild a House</i>) documents their collaboration. He follows Zygmuntowicz through the exacting, scrape-by-scrape process of trying to transform a block of wood into an exquisitely wrought vibrating box that somehow captures the inexpressible sonic essence the finicky Drucker longs to hear. Along the way, Marchese goes on a pilgrimage to Stradivarius's hometown of Cremona and delves into the secrets behind the maestro's incomparable sound. Was it the wood? The varnish? The nap-time transmigration of his spirit into the violin under construction? Zygmuntowicz's example, Marchese finds, suggests a more prosaic, if no less marvelous, possibility&#x2014;that the genius of craftsmanship resides not in magic ingredients or arcane techniques, but simply in taking infinite, exhausting pains with the work, in "caring more and more about less and less." He also broaches a more inflammatory corollary: that modern violins actually sound just as good as Strads. The result is a beguiling journalistic meditation on the links&#x2014;and tensions&#x2014;between art, craft and connoisseurship. <i>(Apr.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

We follow his life as he's driven from his home as a boy and walks, with thousands of orphans, to Ethiopia, where he finds safety &#x2014; for a time. Valentino's travels, truly Biblical in scope, bring him in contact with government soldiers, janjaweed-like militias, liberation rebels, hyenas and lions, disease and starvation &#x2014; and&nbsp;a string of unexpected romances. Ultimately, Valentino finds safety in Kenya and, just after the millennium, is finally resettled in the United States, from where this novel is narrated. In this book, written with expansive humanity and surprising humor, we come to understand the nature of the conflicts in Sudan, the refugee experience in America, the dreams of the Dinka people, and the challenge one indomitable man faces in a world collapsing around him.<br><br></p><p>"Dave Eggers has done something remarkable with this book. He has managed to cross many barriers both real and artificial to tell the story of one man's tragedy and triumph in a way that emphasizes his simple humanity above the drama of his terrible situation. It is a book that shows there is no reason why geographical and cultural divides should prevent us from attempting to understand each other as citizens of this world." <br>--UZODINMA IWEALA, author of Beasts of No Nation <p>"I cannot recall the last time I was this moved by a novel. What is the What is that rare book that truly deserves the overused and scarcely warranted moniker of `sprawling epic.' Told with humor, humanity, and bottomless compassion for his subject, one Valentino Achak Deng, Eggers shows us the hardships, disillusions, and hopes of the long suffering people of southern Sudan. This is the story of one boy's astonishing capacity to endure atrocity after atrocity and yet refuse to abandon decency, kindness, and hope for home and acceptance. It is impossible to read this book and not be humbled, enlightened, transformed. I believe I will never forget Valentino Achak Deng." <br>--KHALED HOSSEINI, author of The Kite Runner </p><p>"What is the What is a novel that possesses the best qualities of a documentary film: the conviction of truthfulness, and the constant reminder of the arbitrariness of fate, for worse and for better.

But he was ready to find out.<br>&nbsp;<br>Moeller nodded absentmindedly at his assistant, who placed the schedule of today&#x2019;s negotiations in front of him, and shifted again in his chair. The tissue surrounding the apparatus itched, but there&#x2019;s no getting around the fact that a ten-centimeter tube of metal and electronics positioned inside your colon, a mere inch or two inside your rectum, is going to cause some discomfort.<br>&nbsp;<br>This much was made clear to Moeller when he was presented with the apparatus by Fixer. &#x201c;The principle is simple,&#x201d; Fixer said, handing the slightly curved thing to Moeller. &#x201c;You pass gas like you normally do, but instead of leaving your body, the gas enters into that forward compartment. The compartment closes off, passes the gas into second department, where additional chemical components are added, depending on the message you&#x2019;re trying to send. Then it&#x2019;s shunted into the third compartment, where the whole mess waits for your signal. Pop the cork, off it goes. You interact with it through a wireless interface. Everything&#x2019;s there. All you have to do is install it.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Does it hurt?&#x201d; Moeller asked. &#x201c;The installation, I mean.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Fixer rolled his eyes. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re shoving a miniature chemistry lab up your ass, Mr. Moeller,&#x201d; Fixer said. &#x201c;Of course it&#x2019;s going to hurt.&#x201d; And it did.<br>&nbsp;<br>Despite that fact, it was an impressive piece of technology. Fixer had created it by adapting it from blueprints he found in the National Archives, dating to when the Nidu and humans made first contact, decades back. The original inventor was a chemical engineer with ideas of bringing the two races together in a concert that featured humans, with the original versions of the apparatus placed near their tracheas, belching out scented messages of friendship.<br>&nbsp;<br>The plan fell apart because no reputable human chorus wanted to be associated with the concert; something about the combination of sustained vocal outgassing and the throat surgery required to install the apparatuses made it rather less than appealing. Shortly thereafter the chemical engineer found himself occupied with a federal investigation into the nonprofit he had created to organize the concert, and then with a term in minimum security prison for fraud and tax evasion. The apparatus got lost in the shuffle and slid into obscurity, awaiting someone with a clear purpose for its use.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;You okay, sir?&#x201d; said Moeller&#x2019;s aide, Alan. &#x201c;You look a little preoccupied. Are you feeling better?&#x201d; Alan knew his boss had been out yesterday with a stomach flu; he&#x2019;d taken his briefings for the today&#x2019;s slate of negotiations by conference call.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m fine, Alan,&#x201d; Moeller said. &#x201c;A little stomach pain, that&#x2019;s all. Maybe something I had for breakfast.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;I can see if anyone has got some Tums,&#x201d; Alan said.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s the last thing I need right now,&#x201d; Moeller said.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Maybe some water, then,&#x201d; Alan said.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;No water,&#x201d; Moeller said. &#x201c;I wouldn&#x2019;t mind a small glass of milk, though. I think that might settle my stomach.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll see if they have anything at the commissary,&#x201d; Alan said. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ve still got a few minutes before everything begins.&#x201d; Moeller nodded to Alan, who set off. Nice kid, Moeller thought. Not especially bright, and new to the trade delegation, but those were two of the reasons he had him as his aide for these negotiations. An aide who was more observant and had been around Moeller longer might have remembered that he was lactose intolerant. Even a small amount of milk would inevitably lead to a gastric event.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Lactose intolerant? Swell,&#x201d; Fixer had said, after the installation. &#x201c;Have a glass of milk, wait for an hour or so. You&#x2019;ll be good to go. You can also try the usual gas-producing foods: beans, broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage, raw onions, potatoes. Apples and apricots also do the trick. Prunes too, but that&#x2019;s probably more firepower than you&#x2019;ll really want. Have a good vegetable medley for breakfast and then stand back.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Any meats?&#x201d; Moeller had asked. He was still a little breathless from the pain of having the apparatus sent up his tailpipe and grafted to his intestine wall.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Sure, anything fatty will work,&#x201d; Fixer said. &#x201c;Bacon, some well-marbled red meat. Corned beef and cabbage will give you a little bit of everything. What, you don&#x2019;t like vegetables?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;My dad was a butcher,&#x201d; Moeller said. &#x201c;I ate a lot of meat as a kid. Still like it.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>More than liked it, really. Dirk Moeller came from a long line of carnivores and proudly ate animal flesh at every meal. Most people didn&#x2019;t do that anymore. And when they did eat meat, they picked out a tube of vatted meat product, made from cultivated tissue that never required the butchering of an animal, or even the participation of any sort of animal outside of the purely mythical. The best-selling vatted meat product on the market was something called Kingston&#x2019;s Bison Boar&#x2122;, some godforsaken agglomeration of bovine and pig genes stretched across a cartilaginous scaffolding and immersed in a nutrient broth until it grew into something that was meatlike without being meaty, paler than veal, lean as a lizard, and so animal friendly that even strict vegetarians didn&#x2019;t mind tucking in a Bison Boar Burger&#x2122; or two when the mood struck them. Kingston&#x2019;s corporate mascot was a pig with a bison shag and horns, frying up burgers on a hibachi, winking at the customer in third-quarter profile, licking its lips in anticipation of devouring its own fictional flesh. The thing was damned creepy.<br>&nbsp;<br>Moeller would have rather roasted his own tongue on a skewer than eat vatted meat. Good butchers were hard to come by these days, but Moeller found one outside of Washington, in the suburb of Leesburg. Ted was a boutique entrepreneur, like all butchers these days. His day job was as a mechanic. But he knew his way around a carving chart, which is more than most people in his line of work could say. Once a year in October, Ted damn near filled up a walk-in freezer in Moeller&#x2019;s basement with beef, pork, venison, and four kinds of bird: chicken, turkey, ostrich, and goose.<br>&nbsp;<br>Because Moeller was his best customer, occasionally Ted would throw in something more exotic, usually a reptile of some kind&#x2014;he got a lot of alligator now that Florida had declared a year-round hunting season on that fast-breeding hybrid species that the EPA introduced to repopulate the Everglades&#x2014;but also an occasional mammal or two whose provenance was often left prudently unattributed. There was that one year when Ted provided ten pounds of steaks and a note scrawled on the butcher paper: &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t ask.&#x201d; Moeller served those at a barbecue with former associates from the American Institute for Colonization. Everyone loved them. Several months later, another butcher&#x2014;not Ted&#x2014;had been arrested for trafficking in meat taken from Zhang-Zhang, a panda on loan to the National Zoo. The panda had disappeared roughly the time Ted made his yearly meat drop. The next year, Ted was back to alligator. It was probably better that way for everyone, except possibly the alligator.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;It all starts with meat,&#x201d; Moeller&#x2019;s father told him often, and as Alan returned with a coffee mug filled with 2%, Moeller reflected on the truth of that simple statement. His current course of action, the one that had him accumulating gas in his intestinal tract, indeed began with meat. Specifically, the meat in Moeller&#x2019;s Meats, the third-generation butcher shop Dirk&#x2019;s father owned. It was into this shop, nearly 40 years ago now, that Faj-win-Getag, the Nidu ambassador, came bursting through the door, trailing an entourage of Nidu and human diplomats behind him. &#x201c;Something smells really good,&#x201d; the Nidu ambassador said.<br>&nbsp;<br>The ambassador&#x2019;s pronouncement was notable in itself. The Nidu, among their many physical qualities, were possessed of a sense of smell several orders of magnitude more fine than the poor human nose. For this reason, and for reasons relating to the Nidu caste structure, which is rigid enough to make 16th-century Japan appear the very model of let-it-all-hang-out egalitarianism, the higher diplomatic and political Nidu castes had developed a &#x201c;language&#x201d; of scents not at all unlike the way the European nobles of Earth developed a &#x201c;language&#x201d; of flowers.<br>&nbsp;<br>Like the noble language of flowers, the Nidu diplomatic scent language was not true speech, in that one couldn&#x2019;t actually carry on a conversation through smells. Also, humans couldn&#x2019;t take much advantage of this language; the human sense of smell was so crude that Nidu trying to send a scent signal would get the same reaction from their intended recipient as they would get by singing an aria to a turtle. But among the Nidu themselves, one could make a compelling opening statement, sent in a subtle way (inasmuch as smells are subtle) and presenting an underpinning for all discourse to follow.<br>&nbsp;<br>When a Nidu ambassador bursts through one&#x2019;s shop door proclaiming something smells good, that&#x2019;s a statement that works on several different levels. One, something probably just smells good. But two, something in the shop has a smell that carries with it certain positive scent identifications for the Nidu. James Moeller, proprietor of Moeller&#x2019;s Meats, Dirk&#x2019;s father, was not an especially worldly man, but he knew enough to know that getting on the Nidu ambassador&#x2019;s good side could mean the difference between his shop&#x2019;s success and its failure. It was hard enough running a dedicated butcher shop in a largely vegetarian world. But now that more of the relatively few meat enthusiasts remaining ate the newly arrived vatted meat&#x2014;which James vehemently refused to stock, to the point of chasing a Kingston&#x2019;s Vatted Meat wholesaler from his store with a cleaver&#x2014;things were getting precarious. The Nidu, James Moeller knew, were committed carnivores. They had to get their vittles from somewhere, and James Moeller was a man of business. Everybody&#x2019;s money was equal in his eyes.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;I smelled it down the street,&#x201d; Faj-win-Getag continued, approaching the counter display. &#x201c;It smelled fresh. It smelled different.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;The ambassador has a good nose,&#x201d; James Moeller said. &#x201c;In the back of the shop I&#x2019;ve got venison, arrived just today from Michigan. It&#x2019;s deer meat.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;I know deer,&#x201d; Faj-win-Getag said. &#x201c;Large animals. They fling themselves at vehicles with great frequency.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s them,&#x201d; James Moeller said.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;They don&#x2019;t smell like what I smell when they&#x2019;re on the side of the road,&#x201d; Faj-win-Getag said.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;They sure don&#x2019;t!&#x201d; James Moeller said. &#x201c;Would you like a better smell of the venison?&#x201d; Faj-win-Getag nodded his assent; James told his son Dirk to bring out some. James presented it to the Nidu ambassador.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;That smells wonderful,&#x201d; Faj-win-Getag said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s very much like a scent that in our custom equates with sexual potency. This meat would be very popular with our young men.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>James Moeller cracked a grin wide as the Potomac. &#x201c;It would honor me to present the ambassador with some venison, with my compliments,&#x201d; he said, shooing Dirk into the back to bring out more of the meat. &#x201c;And I&#x2019;ll be happy to serve any of your people who would want some of their own. We have quite a bit in stock.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll be sure to let my staff know,&#x201d; Faj-win-Getag said. &#x201c;You say you get your stock from Michigan?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Sure do,&#x201d; James said. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s a large preserve in central Michigan run by the Nugentians. They harvest deer and other animals through ritual bow hunting. Legend has it the cult&#x2019;s founder bow-hunted one of every species of North American mammal before he died. They have his body on display at the preserve. He&#x2019;s in a loincloth. It&#x2019;s a religious thing. Not the sort of people you want to spend a lot of time with on a personal basis, but their meat is the best in the country. It costs a little more, but it&#x2019;s worth it. And they have the right attitude about meat&#x2014;it&#x2019;s the cornerstone of any truly healthy diet.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Most humans we meet don&#x2019;t eat much meat,&#x201d; Faj-win-Getag said. &#x201c;What I read in your newspapers and magazines suggests most people find it unhealthy.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t believe it,&#x201d; James Moeller said. &#x201c;I eat meat at every meal. I have more energy physically and mentally than most men half my age. I&#x2019;ve got nothing against vegetarians; if they want to eat beans all the time, that&#x2019;s fine with me. But long after they&#x2019;re asleep in their bed, I&#x2019;m still going strong. That&#x2019;s meat for you. It all starts with meat&#x2014;that&#x2019;s what I tell my customers. That&#x2019;s what I&#x2019;ll tell you.&#x201d; Dirk returned from the back with several large packages of meat; James put them in a heavy-duty bag and placed it on the low counter on the side. &#x201c;All yours, sir. You enjoy that.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;You are too generous,&#x201d; Faj-win-Getag said, as a flunky took the bag. &#x201c;We are always warmed by such hospitality from your race, who is always so giving. It makes us happy that we&#x2019;ll soon be in the neighborhood.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;How do you mean?&#x201d; James Moeller said.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;The Nidu have entered into a number of new treaties and trade agreements with your government, which requires us to greatly expand our presence here,&#x201d; the ambassador said. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll be building our new mission grounds in this neighborhood.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s great,&#x201d; James Moeller said. &#x201c;Will the embassy be close by?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Oh, very close,&#x201d; Faj-win-Getag said, and nodded his goodbyes, taking his venison and his entourage with him.<br>&nbsp;<br>James Moeller didn&#x2019;t waste time. Over the next week he tripled his order of venison from the Nugentians and sent Dirk to the library to find out anything he could about Nidu and their culinary preferences. This led to James ordering rabbit, Kobe beef, imported haggis from Scotland, and, for the very first time in the three-generation history shop, stocking Spam. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s not vatted meat,&#x201d; he said to Dirk. &#x201c;Just meat in a can.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Within a week, James Moeller had transformed his butcher shop into a Nidu-friendly meat store. Indeed, the enlarged shipment of Nugentian venison arrived the very same day that James Moeller received his notice via certified mail that the building that housed Moeller Meats was being seized by the government under eminent domain, along with every other building on the block, to make way for the new and enlarged Nidu embassy. James Moeller&#x2019;s receipt of this letter was also neatly coincident to a massive heart attack that killed him so fast that he was dead before he hit the floor, letter still in his hand, venison still unbutchered in the cold room in the back.<br>&nbsp;<br>Dr. Atkinson tried to assure Dirk that the shock of the letter in itself would not have been enough to kill his father. James&#x2019;s aorta, he explained, was like a cannoli solidly packed with lard, the end result of 53 years of uninterrupted meat consumption. Dr. Atkinson had warned James for years to eat a more balanced diet or at least to allow him to snake out his arteries with an injection of plaque &#x2019;bots, but James always refused; he felt fine, he liked his meat, and he wasn&#x2019;t going to sign off on any medical procedure that would give his insurance company the ammuni...</p><h2>Windows to the World: An Introduction to Literary Analysis Student Book</h2><p>Why do certain literary works have the power to move us?

Pages are clean and binding is tight.</p><p>What, if anything, is it that makes the human uniquely human? This, in part, is the question that G.K. Chesterton starts with in this classic exploration of human history. Responding to the evolutionary materialism of his contemporary (and antagonist) H.G. Wells, Chesterton in this work affirms human uniqueness and the unique message of the Christian faith. Writing in a time when social Darwinism was rampant, Chesterton instead argued that the idea that society has been steadily progressing from a state of primitivism and barbarity towards civilization is simply and flatly inaccurate. "Barbarism and civilization were not successive stages in the progress of the world," he affirms, with arguments drawn from the histories of both Egypt and Babylon. <p> As always with Chesterton, there is in this analysis something (as he said of Blake) "very plain and emphatic." He sees in Christianity a rare blending of philosophy and mythology, or reason and story, which satisfies both the mind and the heart. On both levels it rings true. As he puts it, "in answer to the historical query of why it was accepted, and is accepted, I answer for millions of others in my reply; because it fits the lock; because it is like life." Here, as so often in Chesterton, we sense a lived, awakened faith. All that he writes derives from a keen intellect guided by the heart's own knowledge. <i>--Doug Thorpe</i></p>Gilbert Keith Chesterton (1874-1936) was an English writer whose prolific and diverse output included philosophy, ontology, poetry, plays, journalism, public lectures and debates, literary and art criticism, biography, Christian apologetics, and fiction, including fantasy and detective fiction.</p><h2>Cheesemaking Made Easy</h2><p>This updated edition includes equipment lists, step-by-step instructions, and a troubleshooting chart.<p></p></p><p>Make your own cheese!

A devotional classic, this specimen of practical Christianity is full of biblical application and encouragement.</p><p> This volume also includes a biographical sketch of the author and appended sermon concerning Christ s manifestation of Himself to those who love Him.</p><p> <b>Foreword written by John MacArthur.</b></p></p><p>Thomas Vincent (1634-1678) was born in 1634 in Hertford, England. He was the second son of John Vincent and the elder brother of Nathaniel Vincent. He was educated first at Westminster School, then at Felsted School, Great Dunmow, Essex, an institution of strong Puritan convictions. In 1648 he was elected to Christ Church, Oxford, where he earned a bachelor of arts degree in 1652 and a master of arts degree in 1654. Leaving Oxford, he served as chaplain to Robert Sidney, Second Earl of Leicester. In 1657, Vincent succeeded Thomas Case as rector of St. Mary Magdalen, Milk Street, London, where he remained until he was ejected for nonconformity in 1662.<p> Between his ejection and the Great Plague of 1665, Vincent assisted Thomas Doolittle in educating children at Doolittle s nonconformist academy at Islington. During the plague of 1665, Vincent showed great courage and godly zeal by serving the sick left behind by the conformist ministers who fled the city.</p><p> For the last twelve years of his life, Vincent preached to a large congregation gathered at Hand Alley, off Bishopsgate Street. He was fined and probably imprisoned at least once during those years. He devoted himself extensively to educating young people. Vincent died in 1678, survived by his wife, Mary, and at least four children.</p>Secular history generally paints Puritanism as a rather unsophisticated form of religion. Puritans are usually caricatured as cold, austere, and simplistic, devoid of any appreciation for love and beauty, obsessed with law and judgment. This book surely debunks that myth. It reveals the Puritan passion for &#39;joy inexpressible and full of glory&#39;, which grows out of a warm-hearted, fervent love for Christ. --John MacArthur, from the foreword</p><h2>Mindful Spontaneity: Lessons in the Feldenkrais Method</h2><p>Ruthy Alon's description of Feldenkrais work in <i>Mindful Spontaneity</i> is a favored text of a generation of Feldenkrais enthusiasts.

Have you ever punished your child and later felt guilty for having behaved in a way that you swore you never would? Have you ever promised yourself to exercise regularly, eat better, or spend more time with loved ones, but found that the promises you made to yourself are difficult to keep? Have you then given up, or felt guilty?</p><p>I wrote this book to help you permanently change your own behavior, because only by learning to discipline yourself will you be able to successfully guide your children's behavior. I will show why achieving self-control and self-discipline allows you to know exactly what to do in order to discipline your children.</p><p>If I asked you to teach a class in nuclear physics, could you do it? Probably not. Could you teach your child how to pole-vault? Again, probably not. You cannot teach what you do not know.</p><p>Yet we often demand that children acquire skills that we ourselves lack. We ask children to do as we say, not as we do. Parents <i>yell,</i> "Go to your room until you are in control of yourself." A mother <i>grabs</i> a toy that two preschoolers; are tussling over and says, "You know better than to grab toys from your friends. It's mine now!" Husbands and wives battle with each other, using attack skills such as name-calling and withdrawal. Then they demand that their children resolve conflicts calmly, by discussing them. Our own emotional intelligence is primitive at best, and whether we admit it or not, we pass our emotional clumsiness on to our children.</p><p>For most of us, being consistently in control of ourselves represents a major change. So this book is about change: It's about learning to change your own behavior, and your children's behavior, so that you can grow closer, embrace and resolve conflict, and enjoy life. Once you model self-control for your children, they will show better self-control than you have ever imagined they could achieve. Delightful surprises await you.</p><p><b>Once you model self-control for your children, they will show better self-control than you have ever imagined they could achieve.</b></p><p>Imagine telling your child <i>one</i> time to take a shower--and him actually marching off to do it! Imagine promising yourself to either conquer your clutter, or to relax about it--and then keeping your promise. This book will help you realize these possibilituies and many, many others.</p><p><i>Easy to Love, Difficult to Discipline</i> can help you become the person you want your child to emulate. It will take your self-discipline and child-rearing skills to new levels. You will learn how to move beyond policing your children with rules and consequences, and discover how to create a home in which healthy relationships flourish and your children voluntarily choose to cooperate.</p><p>Sounds impossible? The revised Mother Goose nursery rhyme at the start of this chapter contains all the needed ingredients. If you want your children to change, you must begin by becoming a wonderfully loving adult. You must focus on what you want to have happen instead of what you don't want. You must rely on love, not fear, to motivate yourself and your children. When you learn to love yourself, you will be ready to teach your children to love themselves and one another.</p><p>This is a radically different approach from the one summarized in the original rhyme, which goes like this:</p><p><i>There was an old woman who lived in a shoe,<br>She had so many children<br>She didn't know what to do.<br>She gave them some broth<br>Without any bread;<br>She whipped them all soundly<br>And put them to bed.</i></p><p>Have you ever manipulated your child with food like Mother Goose did? ("If you behave while I shop, I'll take you to McDonald's.") Have you ever, in desperation, spanked your child? Unsure of how to proceed, have you sent your child to his room, or put him in "time out"? How often have you felt like the tired "old woman" (or a tired old dad) after surviving a day with your children, fighting battle after battle? The house really can feel as cramped as a shoe with laces tied too tightly.</p><p>How would tomorrow feel if you did know what to do? When your children tormented one another, you would be able to teach them how to resolve their conflicts, rather than resorting to playing "bad cop." When your children refused to clean up, you would know how to help them move past resistance and toward cooperation, rather than turning to nagging, punishment, or doing the task yourself. When your children lost control, you would know how to help them calm down and reorganize themselves, rather than outshouting them. Imagine knowing exactly what to do!</p><b><p>Times Have Changed and So Must We</p></b><p>When it comes to describing our social situation, "Times have changed" is an understatement. There have been many shifts in our society, yet none so profound as the shift from roles to relationships. Building steam in the late fifties, society began to enter bold new territory. Collectively, we decided that the roles of the past were too limiting. The roles of husband and wife had been explicitly defined. The role of child (to be seen and not heard) and the role of parent (as boss) had been clearly articulated.

When you add fresh mozzarella, Fontina, Parmesan, and mascarpone cheeses to pasta, something out of the ordinary happens. We also add a layer of fresh mozzarella in the middle of the pasta dish, for the ultimate cheese experience, and scatter a mixture of grated Parmesan, thyme, and bread crumbs on top for a crunchy topping. You can make the dish in one large skillet or baking dish, or make it in individual ramekins, but you'll need to reduce the baking time. The dish can be assembled up to 2 hours ahead of time and baked just before serving.<br><br><b>Ingredients</b><br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;1 pound short, textured pasta, such as macaroni, cavatappi, ziti rigati, or penne rigate <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;1 tablespoon unsalted butter <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;2 tablespoons olive oil <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;3 tablespoons all-purpose flour <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;3 cups milk, warmed <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;12 ounces fresh mozzarella cheese, half grated and half very thinly sliced (about 3 cups total) <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;1 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;8 ounces Fontina cheese, grated (about 2 cups) <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;1/4 cup mascarpone cheese <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;Salt and freshly ground black pepper <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;2 tablespoons plus 2 teaspoons chopped fresh thyme leaves <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;1/2 cup plain bread crumbs<br><b>To prepare</b><br> Place a rack in the middle of the oven and preheat oven to 400 degrees Farenheit.<br><br>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to boil over high heat. Add the pasta and cook until barely al dente, 7 to 9 minutes. Drain, return to the pot, and set aside.<br><br>Meanwhile, melt the butter in a medium saucepan with 1 tablespoon of the olive oil over low heat. When the butter has melted completely and begins to sizzle, add the flour and whisk until combined. Cook, stirring constantly, until the mixture begins to bubble, about 1 minute. Add half of the warm milk in a slow, steady stream, whisking until the mixture is smooth and begins to thicken, about 2 minutes. Add the remaining milk, whisk again until smooth, and increase the heat to medium-high, stirring frequently, until the mixture comes to a boil. Remove the sauce from the heat and add the grated mozzarella, half of the Parmesan, and all of the Fontina and mascarpone, whisking constantly to prevent the cheese from becoming lumpy. When the sauce is completely smooth, add salt and pepper to taste and 2 tablespoons of the thyme.<br><br>Pour the sauce over the pasta in the pot and stir to combine completely. Spoon half of the pasta into a large oven-proof skillet or a roughly 9 x 12-inch baking dish, or several smaller dishes (ramekins work really well) and arrange the mozzarella slices evenly over the pasta. Pour the remaining pasta over the cheese layer and spread evenly.<br><br>Mix the remaining Parmesan cheese, the remaining 2 teaspoons thyme, and the bread crumbs together in a small bowl. Sprinkle the mixture evenly over the top of the pasta. Drizzle the remaining tablespoon olive oil evenly over the crust.<br><br>Bake the pasta for 30 to 40 minutes (smaller dishes will bake in 15 to 20 minutes), or until the cheese is bubbly and the crust is golden brown. Serve hot.<br><br><b>Favorite variations</b><br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;Substitute Gruyere, Emmenthaler, or Swiss cheese for the Fontina. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;Substitute crumbled fresh goat cheese for the mascarpone. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;Add 1 cup chopped cooked ham or chicken to the sauce before pouring over the pasta. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;Add 1/2 cup chopped scallions (white and green parts) or finely chopped yellow onion to the cheese sauce. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;Add 1/4 cup chopped parsley leaves, 1/4 cup chopped chives, and 2 tablespoons chopped rosemary leaves to the cheese sauce.</p><h2>King of the Wind: The Story of the Godolphin Arabian</h2><p>He was named &#34;Sham&#34; for the sun, this golden red stallion born in the Sultan of Morocco&#39;s stone stables.Upon his heel was a small white spot, the symbol of speed. But on his chest was the symbol of misfortune.Although he was as swift as the desert winds, Sham&#39;s proud pedigree would be scorned all his lifeby cruel masters and owners. This is the classic story of Sham and his friend, the stable boy Agba. Their adventures take themfrom the sands of the Sahara to the royal courts of France and, finally, to the green pastures andstately homes of England. For Sham was the renowned Godolphin Arabian, whose blood flows through the veinsof almost every superior Thoroughbred. Sham&#39;s speed-like his story-has become legendary.</p><p>Marguerite Henry is the author of the popular Horseshoe library, which includes such titles as <i>Stormy, Misty's Foal, Brighty of the Grand Canyon,</i> and <i>King of the Wind</i>.King of the Wind <br><br> 1. The Fast of Ramadan<p></p> <br>IN THE northwestern slice of Africa known as Morocco, a horseboy stood, with broom in hand, in the vast courtyard of the royal stables of the Sultan. He was waiting for dusk to fall.<br> <br>All day long he had eaten nothing. He had not even tasted the jujubes tucked in his turban nor the enormous purple grapes that spilled over the palace wall into the stable yard. He had tried not to sniff the rich, warm fragrance of ripening pomegranates. For this was the sacred month of Ramadan when, day after day, all faithful Mohammedans neither eat nor drink from the dawn before sunrise until the moment after sunset.<br> <br>The boy Agba had not minded the fast for himself. It was part of his religion. But when Signor Achmet, Chief of the Grooms, commanded that the horses, too, observe the fast, Agba&#x2019;s dark eyes smouldered with anger.<br> <br>&#x201c; It is the order of the Sultan! &#x201d; the Signor had announced to the horseboys. And he had cuffed Agba on the head when the boy showed his disapproval.<br> <br>Of the twelve thousand horses in the Sultan&#x2019;s stables, Agba had charge of ten. He fed and watered them and polished their coats and cleaned their stalls. Best of all, he wheeled the whole string into the courtyard at one time for their exercise.<br> <br><br> <br>There was one of the ten horses to whom Agba had lost his heart. She was a bay mare, as fleet as a gazelle, with eyes that studied him in whatever he did. The other nine horses he would lead out to the common water trough to drink. But for his bright bay he would fill a water cask from a pure spring beyond the palace gates. Then he would hold it while the mare sucked the water, her eyelashes brushing his fingers as she drank. For long moments after she had drunk her fill, she would gaze at him while the cool water dribbled from her muzzle onto his hands.<br> <br>It was the mare that worried Agba now as he worked to fill in the time until the hour of sunset. The courtyard was already swept clean but Agba pushed his palm-leaf broom as if he were sweeping all his thoughts into a little mound for the wind to carry away.<br> <br>At last he hung his broom on an iron hook, alongside an endless row of brooms, and went to the mare. Her stall door was closed so that the fragrance of late clover would not drift in to prick her appetite. He found her asleep, lying on her side, her great belly distended by the little colt soon to be born. Agba noticed, with a heavy feeling in his chest, that the fast was telling on the mare. He could read it in the sunken places above each eye, in the harshness of her coat.<br> <br>But soon the fast would be over. It was the last day of the month, and even now the sun was sinking below the gray-green olive trees that fringed the courtyard.<br> <br>There was no sound anywhere, not from the palace walls beyond, nor from the quarters over the stables where the horseboys lived. The whole world seemed to be holding its breath, waiting for dusk to fall. Small voices of insects and birds were beginning to pierce the quiet. Twilight toads piping on their bassoons. Crickets chirping. Wood doves cooing. And afar off in the Atlas Mountains a hyena began to laugh. These were forerunners of the darkness. It would be only a short time now.<br> <br>Agba turned toward the east, his eyes on the minaret of the mosque. It was a sharp needle pricking the blood-red reflection of the sun. He gazed fixedly at it until his eyes smarted. At last a figure in white robes emerged from the tower. It was the public crier. He was sounding his trumpet. He was crying four times to the four winds of heaven. The fast of Ramadan was at an end!<br> <br><br> <br>The air went wild with noise. Twelve thousand horses recognized the summons and neighed their hunger. The royal stables seethed like an ant hill. Horseboys swarmed out of the corridors and into the courtyard. From the hoods of their cloaks, from waistbands and vests, they took dates and raisins and almonds and popped them noisily into their mouths. They stripped the grapes from their vines. They ate with boisterous abandon. Some plunged their faces into the troughs and sucked the water as if they were horses.<br> <br>Agba did not join the other horseboys. He returned to the mare. Moving slowly so as not to frighten her, he reached under the saddle hung on the wall and found the water vessel he had filled and hidden there an hour ago. He poured the water into a basin and waited for the mare to awaken.<br> <br>As if she had heard in her dreams the sound made by the water, she woke with a jerk and struggled to her feet. She came to Agba and drank. Then she raised her head, letting the water slobber from her lips.<br> <br>Agba waited motionless, knowing she would want more and more. Her deep brown eyes studied him as if to say, &#x201c;You are the source of all that is good.&#x201d;<br> <br>A great happiness welled up inside Agba. He nodded, seeming to understand her thoughts, then waited while she drank again and again.<br> <br>When Agba came out of the mare&#x2019;s stall, the other boys were beginning to lead their horses to the common trough to drink. He must hurry now if he hoped to get his corn ration first. He picked up a bag made of hemp and ran through a maze of corridors and down a steep staircase to the underground granary. At the entrance stood Signor Achmet, Chief of the Grooms. Signor Achmet was dark and bearded. In his right hand he carried a knotted stick, and from the sash at his waist hung a hundred keys. When he saw Agba, he gripped the boy&#x2019;s shoulder with fingers as strong as the claws of an eagle.<br> <br>&#x201c;Why do you not eat with the other slaveboys? &#x201d; he asked in his cracked voice. Then with a sharp look he released Agba and began peeling an orange with his fingernails. His beady eyes did not leave Agba&#x2019;s face as he ate the orange, making loud sucking noises to show how juicy and good it was.<br> <br>Agba gulped. He studied his brown toes.<br> <br>&#x201c;Is it the mare?&#x201d;<br> <br>The boy&#x2019;s eyes flew to the Signor&#x2019;s.<br> <br>&#x201c;Is tonight her hour?&#x201d;<br> <br>Slowly, gravely, Agba nodded.<br> <br>&#x201c;Tonight, then,&#x201d; the Signor said, as he wiped his mouth on his mantle and began fumbling for the key to the granary, &#x201c;tonight you will not go to your quarters to sleep. You will move the mare into the brood-mare stable. You will remain on watch and call me when she is ready to foal. The all-seeing eye of Allah will be upon you.&#x201d;<br> <br>Agba&#x2019;s heart fluttered like bird wings. The Chief of the Grooms was letting him stay with his mare! He forgot all the cuffs and sharp words. He bowed low, impatient to hear the sound of the key turning the great lock, impatient for the creaking of the door and the mingled odors of corn and barley.<br> <br>The key scraped. The door creaked open. The warm, mellow smells leaked out.<br> <br>Signor Achmet stood aside. Agba slipped past him into the darkness.

His books have been translated into twenty-five languages, and his Conversations with God series, book 1, book 2, and book 3, have all been <b>New York Times</b> bestsellers-book 1 for over two years.<br><br>In the Conversations books, Walsch shared with his readers the beginning of a sacred relationship, as he began an exchange with God on everything from love and faith, to life and death, and good and evil. And then, as Walsch recounted in <b>Friendship with God</b>, something else extraordinary began to happen. His relationship with God began to strengthen and deepen, just as our own relationships do, into a friendship.<br><br>Now in <b>Communion with God</b>, his most richly intimate book yet, Walsh discovers how to elevate that friendship to a state of communion. In this blueprint for seekers, he reveals The Ten Illusions of Man<b>&#x2014;</b>the misconceptions we hold about ourselves and our world and our God. He describes with striking clarity how we might heal the great divide that has arisen from these illusions. And as he explores the true meaning of bringing God into our everyday lives, of having the courage of our convictions, Walsch shows us that we can only break free from our illusions when we act always from a place of deep fellowship with all that is holy<b>&#x2014;</b>a place of communion with God.</p><p>Bestselling author Neale Donald Walsch (<i>Conversations with God</i>) moves beyond showing readers how to develop a friendship with God and instead offers a model for communion. Rather than using the dialog format, where Walsch shares personal conversations he has with God, he chose to write through the narrative voice of God--as if God were speaking directly to the reader. "I tell you this: You need nothing to survive," says God. "Your survival is guaranteed. I gave you everlasting life, and I never took it away from you." This format can feel a bit jarring, as if this was an attempt at channeling rather than Walsch's usual humble style of dialogue. Using a structure of top-10 illusions, Walsch has God speaking to illusions such as need, judgment, and superiority. At times God sounds scolding: "For I tell you this: Your idea of superiority could be the last mistake you ever make." Yet, the bottom-line message is that of unconditional love and the exhilarating promise of communion--a gift that is lavishly offered throughout the final chapters. <i>--Gail Hudson</i><b>Neale Donald Walsch</b> is the author of the <b>New York Times</b> bestsellers: <b>Conversations with God book 1, book 2, and book 3</b>, as well as <b>Meditations from Conversations with God book 1 and book 2</b>, and the <b>Conversations with God book 1 Guidebook</b>.

The brave souls that leaped into these dangerous contraptions and pushed them to unexplored extremes became new American heroes: the race car driver and the flying ace.</p><p>No individual did more to create and intensify these raw new roles than the tall, gangly Eddie Rickenbacker, who defied death over and over with such courage and pluck that a generation of Americans came to know his face better than the president's. The son of poor, German-speaking Swiss immigrants in Columbus, Ohio, Rickenbacker overcame the specter of his father's violent death, a debilitating handicap, and, later, accusations of being a German spy, to become the American military ace of aces in World War I and a Medal of Honor recipient. He and his high-spirited, all-too-short-lived pilot comrades, created a new kind of aviation warfare, as they pushed their machines to the edge of destruction&#x2015;and often over it&#x2015;without parachutes, radios, or radar. </p><p><i>Enduring Courage</i> is the electrifying story of the beginning of America's love affair with speed&#x2015;and how one man above all the rest showed a nation the way forward. No simple daredevil, he was an innovator on the racetrack, a skilled aerial dualist and squadron commander, and founder of Eastern Air Lines. Decades after his heroics against the Red Baron's Flying Circus, he again showed a war-weary nation what it took to survive against nearly insurmountable odds when he and seven others endured a harrowing three-week ordeal adrift without food or water in the Pacific during World War II. </p><p>For the first time, <i>Enduring Courage</i> peels back the layers of hero to reveal the man himself. With impeccable research and a gripping narrative, John F. Ross tells the unforgettable story of a man who pushed the limits of speed, endurance and courage and emerged as an American legend.</p></p><p><p>JOHN F. ROSS is the author of <i>War on the Run: The Epic Story of Robert Rogers and the Conquest of America's First Frontier</i>. Winner of the Fort Ticonderoga Prize for Contributions to American History, he has served as the Executive Editor of <i>American Heritage</i> and on the Board of Editors at <i>Smithsonian</i> magazine.</p>1. <br>&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; <br>LOVE AT FIRST SIGHT <br>&nbsp; <br>One warm day in 1905, a scrawny, towheaded fourteen-year-old raced down the sidewalk toward a crowd gathering at High and Broad streets in Columbus, Ohio, easily overtaking several horse-drawn wagons plodding along the brick-lined pavement, bells jingling on their reins. He dodged around customers exiting wide-awninged stores as a trolley hummed down the middle of High beneath a series of iron arches hung with still-novel electric lights. <br>Eddie Rickenbacher wriggled through the crowd to reach a glittering object that he would soon learn was a brand-new 10-horsepower Ford Model C, first of its kind in this midwestern city. He had never seen anything so beautiful. Its brass steering column hovered over an elegant black leather, horsehair-stuffed bench seat; its chassis rested upon large grayish wheels with yellow spokes, accented with mudguards resembling startled eyebrows. Often enough the boy had watched the earth-shaking steam behemoths of the Second Industrial Revolution rumbling through Columbus&#x2019;s vast yards, but locomotives were dirty, rail-bound monsters. Here was a creation clean, sleek, and streamlined, not constrained to rails and, most important, designed to human scale and individuality. <br>Only after a minute or two did the boy register the salesman&#x2019;s voice extolling his chariot&#x2019;s miraculous new features. The pitchman&#x2019;s vaudeville-inspired flourishes left the crowd dubious. The claim that everyone would soon own one seemed the wildest snake-oil hyperbole. To sit atop a box barely able to contain a series of violent, noisy explosions was surely dangerous, if not downright suicidal. Trusting something that exuded not natural horsey sweat but oil and smoke&#x2014;and made an unholy clamor as well&#x2014;must be folly indeed. &#x201c;It is a far step from the innate intelligence of the horse and the companionship of the dog to the blind power and mere possession of the machine,&#x201d; wrote one journalist ominously in 1900. Furthermore, its inner workings were inscrutably hidden, the stuff of sorcery. The crowd had heard about these &#x201c;crazy firewagons&#x201d; ripping at dangerous, unpredictable speeds through the measured, long-established, and reassuring rhythms of horse-drawn traffic, past the commerce of steam and canal. These juggernauts were visibly quixotic, unreliable, and uncontrollable. All of this was true enough. Yet this vehicle of the future nonetheless declared itself with mesmerizing boldness. <br>Searching the faces of the crowd, the salesman locked onto Eddie&#x2019;s dark brown eyes. Little distinguished this immigrants&#x2019; son from the thousands of other urchins roaming the streets of every American city. On his thin frame hung clean but threadbare clothes. Between two winglike ears sat a nose bent where a punch had broken it. One scar grooved his chin, another his cheek. Yet perhaps the salesman saw early what others would soon recognize: a deep, burning fire in the eyes, made the more vivid by contrast with their soot-dark brows, which bespoke not desperation and brute endurance but a deep and abiding curiosity. <br>Maybe the salesman could sway his tough audience by giving this boy a ride. After all, what could be so dangerous if a kid could take a spin? The hawker needed to score a deal soon; Mr. Ford drove his salesmen hard. <br>&#x201c;Want to go for a ride?&#x201d; he asked. &#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; gasped Eddie. The man reached to the steering column and elevated a lever just beneath the wheel to retard the spark plug. (By doing so he prevented the engine from firing prematurely while he cranked the car to start, inflicting a kickback powerful enough to break a hand or wrist.) <br>Reaching under the floor, he flicked a dowellike pin under the kickboard beneath the seat to turn on the ignition. He grabbed the foot-long crank handle and fitted its clawlike end into a brass-rimmed hole just above the running board on the driver&#x2019;s side, jerking the handle&#x2019;s wooden grip from its downward orientation into the twelve o&#x2019;clock position. The two-cylinder engine shuddered and rat-tat-tatted into noisy animation. The crowd tittered in anticipation. A wisp of smoke escaped from the exhaust. The spoked wheels rattled with promise. To Eddie and the others assembled, the loud clicking hum was entirely foreign, what John Dos Passos would call &#x201c;the new noise of the automobile.&#x201d; <br>Having depressed the steering-column handle, the salesman walked around to pull himself aboard with a fluid tug on the wheel. Eddie hopped onto the running board and slid in beside him. His host drew on a rope to swing free the wooden chock locking his rear right tire and shoved back the brass lever by his right elbow. The machine slid forward. Shouting that he&#x2019;d be back for others, the salesman shifted the lever again, the car slowly picking up momentum as he pulled out onto the street. In moments, they had reached an impressive 13 miles per hour. The boy had hit higher speeds on a bicycle, but this ride&#x2019;s sheer exhilarating freedom was different. Instead of being pushed forward like a bicycle or pulled on a horse cart, he felt lifted up and along&#x2014;and carried away. Aproned shop owners, tired teamsters atop their wagons, and annoyed gentlemen on horseback gazed at this portent with little short of wonder. Sitting in that marvel, Eddie was no longer the poor immigrant&#x2019;s son but something altogether more glorious and potent: the personification of speed, modernity, and movement at will. <br>Perched higher than in a modern-day SUV, yet without the protection of a windshield or even a dash, the driver and his passenger experienced the dizzying, electrifying raw rush of motion that jangled the senses and watered the eyes while the scenery blurred and the wind plucked at their clothes. The seat swayed pleasantly, like a ship at sea. The salesman leaned forward, his hands clenching the wheel. The Model C&#x2019;s steering was not geared, and so even the slightest jerk from a pothole or bump could careen this king of the road into a nearby carriage or ditch. Nor, furthermore, had Henry Ford and his engineers yet come up with an effective means of stopping. Braking was a carefully choreographed dance of shifting to low gear and madly pumping the footbrake. The driver devoted his attention to anticipating possible hazards and steering well clear of large obstacles. <br>To Eddie and the salesman, such difficulties weren&#x2019;t limitations; the car was all possibility, a taste of sensations never before so satisfactorily encountered, which delivered an exhilarating sense of rumbling headlong into the future. In those electric moments, as the car described a circuit around Ohio&#x2019;s white-marbled, Greek Revival Statehouse, a dream took shape for that wide-eyed boy: a point where instinct, joy, and rational thought fused together. He would build and drive these new creations&#x2014;a determination that he would ride into becoming one of the most famous Americans of his generation. In a few short years, everyone in Columbus would know his name; a decade later, every American would recognize the wide, confident grin that broke the craggy angles of his face. As for the salesman, his crazy claims would prove right far more quickly than most anyone had dreamed. By the next decade a significant part of a car-crazy nation would own cars. <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* <br>At the turn of the twentieth century, the everyday world of America, still framed around technologies from the age of Andrew Jackson, was being upended by a prodigious sequence of breakthroughs. Americans were putting industrial machinery to unprecedented large-scale use, inventing petroleum fuel, the telephone, pasteurized milk, and the cinema. At the World&#x2019;s Columbian Exposition just a few years earlier, visitors had gawked at typewriters, refrigerators, and flexible artificial limbs. Flush toilets and Edison&#x2019;s bright incandescent bulbs created a particular stir, one breathless writer announcing in <i>Scientific American</i> that this effervescence of discovery was like &#x201c;a gigantic tidal wave of human ingenuity and resource, so profound in its thought, so fruitful in its wealth, so beneficial in its results, that the mind is strained and embarrassed in its effort to expand to a full appreciation of it.&#x201d; In scope and magnitude, the Yankee ingenuity of America&#x2019;s independent inventors&#x2014;Thomas Alva Edison, Orville and Wilbur Wright, Henry Ford, Alexander Graham Bell&#x2014;rivaled if not surpassed the inventive power of Periclean dramatists, Renaissance artists, late-nineteenth-century Berlin physicists, and Weimar architects in the 1920s. <br>The year that Eddie climbed onto that glistening Ford, an obscure German-born scientist named Albert Einstein had advanced his special theory of relativity, which would burst out its profound practical consequences before midcentury. The ripples of this and other discoveries tore the fabric of society&#x2014;and knocked down many traditional modes of living and working. Wassily Kandinsky executed his first abstract painting, <i>Picture with a Circle,</i> in 1911, and that same year Cubism emerged. Virginia Woolf claimed that &#x201c;human character changed&#x201d; in 1910, as modernity itself was born and novels shook off their Victorian crinolines and experimented wildly in form. Syncopated jazz and ragtime rhythms introduced new tempos. Early Hollywood films, shot at sixteen frames a second but shown in theaters at twenty-four frames a second, showed their actors racing along in hyperfast apparent motion, frantic to get to wherever they were going at superhuman speeds. Pocket watches, once owned only by train conductors and the rich, became suddenly cheap and generally available. For the first time, people began systematically to mark time in increments of five and ten minutes. <br>Yet there is a powerful case to be made that no invention would propel the twentieth century forward with greater force than the newly configured internal combustion engine, which would power its first practical car in 1895 and make sustained, heavier-than-air flight possible only eight years later. These new technologies captivated the nation&#x2019;s imagination as they burst cometlike into American life. Within a few short years of Ford&#x2019;s introduction of the Model T in 1908, the chance to control, exercise, and enjoy speed passed into the eager hands of hundreds of thousands of ordinary Americans. Seated behind his wheel, a driver effortlessly multiplied choice as well as speed. For the first time in history, multitudes without specialized skills could operate a machine regularly capable of outdistancing the fastest stallion. Nor did the driver have to interact with a creature with its own mind, which might decide to pull up midstride or even pitch its rider. Speed was now tamable to a whole host of new purposes. <br>Drivers related breathlessly how the countryside dissolved into an Impressionist blur as they rattled down even terrible roads; this would prove just the first taste of the new perspectives that individual high-speed mobility would bring America. It wasn&#x2019;t only the thrill of high velocity but the feeling of being lifted by the rush of acceleration itself, as well as the mild g-forces that pressed the body at turns, even the mystery of swift deceleration. While the experience of flying itself would remain out of most people&#x2019;s reach for decades, the increasingly more common sight of men soaring among and above the birds dissolved whole categories of the impossible. <br>&#x201c;The world loves speed,&#x201d; wrote a journalist in 1902. &#x201c;All mankind would in some form indulge in it, if it but could. He who cannot, finds zest in watching him who can and does indulge&nbsp;&#x2026; The love of speed is inherent and increasing in intensity. The automobile is spreading and will continue to spread the desire for swift and exhilarating flight through space.&#x201d; Tasting the excitement of speed regularly&#x2014;being able to divert it, revel in it, and put it to astonishing use&#x2014;Americans would break open new horizons. The frontier lay not beyond the forest or across the river but at the end of a clutch. Nothing had ever quite so intoxicated the nation. <br>When Eddie climbed into that nearly prototypical Ford, there was no Indy 500 or NASCAR; there were no hot-rodding clubs or drag-racing cliques. Not one single person had water-skied, let alone gone out on a Jet Ski. The notion of doing everything much faster began to pervade all aspects of American life. It was happening in surgery and radio, and very soon on the edge of war. Zipping into the American lexicon would be new words that would communicate previously unimagined realities: zoom, rpm, mph, revving, and redline. Beyond that stretched new reaches of car-possibilities: car camping, drive-in movies, road trips, cruising the strip, Route 66 and the interstates, rest stops, suburban commuting, tailgating, and soccer moms. <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* <br>One late night in 1881, an attractive young woman with a shock of tied-back red hair and dark circles under her blue eyes stepped off a train at Columbus&#x2019;s Union Station. The shadowy figures of workmen in the yard made her nervous, so she hurried into the grand brick and stone terminal, which sprouted two tall mansard-roofed towers along with arched portals and windows with elaborately carved stone lintels. Still unsteady from her recent Atlantic crossing, she walked into the immense waiting room. Certainly she had visualized this moment, her imagination providing far more sustenance across the Atlantic than the small wheel of cheese she had hidden in the folds of her long dress. The only powerful relic of her former life was a black leather-bound family Bible. <br>That she was alone and spoke no English did not slow her determined stride across the platform to find the stationmaster. He did not understand the words that tumbled out of her mouth, which only grew more insistent under his blank stare. Her eyes welled up. She pulled out a letter and held it out to him. Recognizing that it was written in German, he sent an employee running off into the dark. Her brother&#x2019;s letter made it plain that she must leave the stubborn, infertile mountain slopes of the Swiss canton of Basel-Landschaft. He offered brief words of encouragement, but the enclosed money for her passage&#x2014;earned so quickly in America!&#x2014;spoke more than anything else to this new land&#x2019;s possibilities. <br>A German-speaking man, who she learned was the sheriff, came to the station and took her to the farm where her brother worked. When they finally met, she cried so hard that they thought she wanted to go home. No, she explained, <i>no.</i> So she set to farm chores, eventually finding her way to a factory job. <br>The United States was indeed a world apart from the farmhouse into which two Swiss families had been crammed. The sixth of ten children born to a poor ribbon maker, Lizzie had inherited a fiery disposition that often brought her trouble. As one of the youngest girls, she had to wind thread onto the little bobbins that her older sisters used on the loom. Bored to distraction, she tied knots in the thread. Her angry father shut her for hours in a cramped storage closet. <br>When her best friend&#x2014;a similarly redheaded sprite named Louisa&#x2014;died at age thirteen, Louisa&#x2019;s father came to ask Elizabeth&#x2019;s whether she might come to live with them; it was not uncommon to farm a daughter out. Eavesdropping from behind a door, she heard her father say, &#x201c;She is no good around here, she may go.&#x201d; <br>Lizzie could not&#x2014;or pretended not to&#x2014;understand her mother&#x2019;s tears nor her father&#x2019;s stern looks when he delivered the news. &#x201c;I only saw adventure ahead,&#x201d; she later remembered, with the positive spin on past events that decades later would shape her son&#x2019;s own recollections. She had spent four years in her new home when her brother&#x2019;s letter arrived. <br>Lizzie joined hundreds of thousands of...</p><h2>The Lathe of Heaven: A Novel (Perennial Classics)</h2><p><p>George Orr is a man who discovers he has the peculiar ability to dream things into being -- for better or for worse.

Andrew Crowther, a wealthy retired manufacturer, is found dead in his seat on the 12.30 flight from Croydon to Paris. Rather less orthodox is the ensuing flashback in which we live with the killer at every stage, from the first thoughts of murder to the strains and stresses of living with its execution. Seen from the criminal's perspective, a mild-mannered Inspector by the name of French is simply another character who needs to be dealt with.</p><p><strong>This is an unconventional yet gripping story of intrigue, betrayal, obsession, justification and self-delusion. And will the killer get away with it?</strong></p></p><p><p><strong>FREEMAN WILLS CROFTS</strong> (1879-1957) was one of the pre-eminent writers in the golden age of British crime fiction. He was the author of more than thirty detective novels, and was greatly acclaimed by peers such as Agatha Christie and Raymond Chandler.</p>The title of this worthy golden age mystery from Crofts (1879&#x2013;1957), originally published in 1934, refers to an early morning plane flight from Croydon, England, to Paris. When cantankerous retired businessman Andrew Crowther suddenly dies aboard the flight, the official verdict is suicide. Crowther&#x2019;s ambitious nephew, Charles Swinburn, is relieved that his uncle&#x2019;s inheritance will save him from ruin. Charles sets about keeping the family company afloat and winning the love of his life, Una. When evidence of foul play emerges, everyone with a link to Crowther becomes a suspect in his death. Unusually, most of the story is told in third person from the killer&#x2019;s perspective. Even though readers know that the perpetrator should and must come to justice, they will find themselves eagerly anticipating his next devious move.

Another first-rate reissue from the British Library Crime Classics series. STARRED REVIEW (Connie Fletcher <i>Booklist</i>)<br><br>An old-fashioned but steadily absorbing account of a decent man's descent into corruption and murder. One of Crofts' best. (<i>Kirkus Reviews</i>)<br><br>This detective novel is a little different from the norm. Firstly, we see very little of the police or the investigator. Instead, it follows the murderer, Charles Swinburn, throughout as he realises he has a major problem financially, through his efforts to raise the capital he needs, to the planning and carrying out of the murder of his uncle. The story continues as he tries to live his life knowing what he has done and trying to get away with the deed.~~~ I liked the close following of procedures, especially late in the book. The tension is there and I think it would stand up today as well as it did in its day. (Matthew Barnes <i>Carpe Libris</i>)</p><h2>In a Different Key: The Story of Autism</h2><p><b>Finalist for the 2017 Pulitzer Prize in General Nonfiction<br><br>An extraordinary narrative history of autism: the riveting story of parents fighting for their children &#x2019;s civil rights; of doctors struggling to define autism; of ingenuity, self-advocacy, and profound social change.</b><br><br>Nearly seventy-five years ago,&nbsp;Donald Triplett of Forest, Mississippi, became the first&nbsp;child diagnosed&nbsp;with&nbsp;autism. Beginning with his family&#x2019;s odyssey, <i>In a Different Key</i> tells the extraordinary story of this often misunderstood condition, and of the civil rights battles waged by the families of those who have it. Unfolding over decades, it is a beautifully rendered history of ordinary people determined to secure a place in the world for those with autism&#x2014;by liberating children from dank institutions, campaigning for their right to go to school, challenging expert opinion on what it means to have autism, and persuading society to accept those who are different.&nbsp; <br><br>It is the story of women like Ruth Sullivan, who rebelled against a medical establishment that blamed cold and rejecting &#x201c;refrigerator mothers&#x201d; for causing autism; and of fathers who pushed scientists to dig harder for treatments. Many others played starring roles too: doctors like Leo Kanner, who pioneered our understanding of autism; lawyers like Tom Gilhool, who took the families&#x2019; battle for education to the courtroom; scientists who sparred over how to treat autism; and those with autism, like Temple Grandin, Alex Plank, and Ari Ne&#x2019;eman, who explained their inner worlds and championed the philosophy of neurodiversity. <br><br>This is also a story of fierce controversies&#x2014;from the question of whether there is truly an autism &#x201c;epidemic,&#x201d; and whether vaccines played a part in it; to scandals involving &#x201c;facilitated communication,&#x201d; one of many treatments that have proved to be blind alleys; to stark disagreements about whether scientists should pursue a cure for autism. There are dark turns too: we learn about experimenters feeding LSD to children with autism, or shocking them with electricity to change their behavior; and the authors reveal compelling evidence that Hans Asperger, discoverer of the syndrome named after him, participated in the Nazi program that consigned disabled children to death.<br><br>By turns intimate and panoramic,&nbsp;<i>In a Different Key</i>&nbsp;takes us on a journey from an era when families were shamed and children were condemned to institutions to one in which a cadre of people with autism push not simply for inclusion, but for a new understanding of autism: as difference rather than disability.</p><p><b>JOHN&nbsp;DONVAN&nbsp;</b>is&nbsp;a&nbsp;multiple&nbsp;Emmy&nbsp;Award-winning&nbsp;correspondent for ABC and the moderator of the Intelligence Squared U.S. debate series.

That year, up to six thousand visitors each day took Route 11 into far northern Ontario for the sole purpose of gawking at the babies. By order of the provincial government, they had recently been removed from the care of their farmer parents, to be raised instead in a hurriedly built &#x201c;hospital&#x201d; situated not far from the family farmhouse. There they would have indoor plumbing, electricity, and a &#x201c;scientific&#x201d; upbringing overseen by a full-�time doctor and two full-�time nurses.<br><br> Three times a day, on cue, the girls were carried out to a grass-�covered &#x201c;play area&#x201d; just a few yards from where a crowd waited for them. The audience was packed into a specially designed viewing arcade, tented and fitted with one-�way screens so that the girls could never see who was making all the noise. Invariably, the moment they came into view, a warm sigh would float aloft, followed by coos, squeals, and scattered applause at the sight of history&#x2019;s first surviving identical quintuplets, who had been given only hours to live the night they were born, in May of the previous year.<br><br> Exotic by virtue of their genetic rarity, the Dionne quintuplets imprinted themselves indelibly on their generation. They were a matched set, yet unmatched in the example they set of human resilience, the most famous children on earth. The future queen of England would visit them. Mae West, Clark Gable, and Bette Davis all made the trip north. So did Amelia Earhart, six weeks before her final flight, not to mention thousands of ordinary families on vacation.<br><br> All were transfixed, but never, apparently, troubled by the bizarreness, even cruelty, of the arrangement&#x2014;�the girls&#x2019; separation from their parents and from other children, their confinement in a setting they were allowed to leave only three times over the course of nine years, their government&#x2019;s exploitation of a random biological novelty to bring tourist dollars into a depressed province. It was estimated that the public exhibition of the girls, known as Quintland, increased revenues for Ontario by $110 million over those nine years.<br><br> The family shared in some of the riches as well. By the time the girls&#x2019; father sued successfully to reunite the family, well into World War II, he was driving a Cadillac. Money had also poured in from movie deals, contracts for exclusive interviews, and a series of endorsements that put the girls&#x2019; faces in almost every kitchen in America&#x2014;�on calendars, bottles of Karo syrup, and boxes of Quaker Oats. For years to come, no seasonal ritual came or went&#x2014;�not Christmas Eve, not Halloween night, not Mother&#x2019;s Day&#x2014;�without glowing newspaper and magazine stories catching readers up with the Dionne quints.<br><br> It was no surprise that the girls would also mean something to a little boy named Donald, who was growing up in Forest, Mississippi, a small town nearly as rural as theirs. Though only eight months older than them, Donald was already able to recite their names: Emilie, Cecile, Marie, Yvonne, and Annette.<br><br> Except that, for Donald, these were not the names of girls. They were colors inside bottles.<br><br> &#x201c;Annette and Cecile make purple,&#x201d; he would declare as he sketched, handling his set of paint bottles. In a sense, he had it right, insofar as his &#x201c;Annette&#x201d; bottle contained blue paint, and &#x201c;Cecile&#x201d; held red. But while his color theory was sound, his reaction to the girls was peculiar. Unlike everyone else, Donald was captivated not by the girls&#x2019; humanity or the astonishing fact of their survival but by the raw geometry of their sameness. They came in an identical set of five. Just like his bottles. But they were also different, like the paint inside his bottles. It seems to have been this paradox that caught and held his attention.<br><br> If it had only been a game he was playing&#x2014;�some deliberate silli�ness or make-�believe&#x2014;�then what Donald called his paint bottles would never have mattered much to anyone but himself. Certainly it would not be a story worth telling so many decades later. But he was serious. Blue was Annette and red was Cecile, relentlessly and earnestly, whether Donald was drawing with crayons or talking about a candy cane. He was inflexible about this, and much else besides.<br><br> The word &#x201c;yes,&#x201d; for example, always had to mean one thing and one thing only: that he wanted to be hoisted up onto his dad&#x2019;s shoulders. &#x201c;You&#x201d; was his fixed way of saying &#x201c;I,&#x201d; and vice versa. Some words, like &#x201c;chrysanthemum,&#x201d; &#x201c;business,&#x201d; and &#x201c;trumpet vine,&#x201d; he repeated endlessly, with no decipherable intention. He was once observed staring into empty space, writing letters with his fingers in the air, commenting as he went along, &#x201c;Semicolon, capital, twelve, twelve, slain slain; I could put a little comma.&#x201d;<br><br> The way he thought about numbers was also unique. When he was seven, an examiner asked him a question from the Binet-�Simon IQ test, as it was then called: &#x201c;If I were to buy four cents&#x2019; worth of candy and give the storekeeper ten cents, how much would I get back?&#x201d; &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll draw a hexagon,&#x201d; he said in reply. Internally the gears were obviously meshing, but they seemed to slip, critically, when the task was to communicate clearly with others. His was a language of hexagons and chrysanthemums, whether it made sense to others or not.<br><br> Indeed, Donald showed scant interest in the inhabitants of the outside world, and that included his parents. Of all his peculiarities, this was the most difficult for them to accept&#x2014;�that he never ran to his father when he came home from work, and that he almost never cried for his mother. Relatives were unable to engage him, and when Santa showed up one Christmas, in what seems to have been a calculated effort to break through to the little boy, Donald paid him no heed whatsoever.<br><br> Seemingly oblivious to the people around him, he would turn violent the instant his activities were interrupted, whether he was sketching words in the air or spinning pot lids on the floor. Over time, it became clear that he was protecting something: sameness. Pure, unadulterated routine. He could not tolerate even the slightest changes to his physical surroundings. Furniture could not be moved, walks outdoors had to retrace exactly steps already taken, and toys had to be arranged precisely as he had left them. Anything out of place would set off wild tantrums.<br><br> Of course, this meant Donald had to be able to remember the arrangements of things, and for this he relied on his astounding capacity for recall. He could watch his father put different-�colored beads on a string and then reproduce the pattern without a single glance at the original. He could rebuild a tower of blocks that had been knocked over exactly as it had been, each side of each block facing in its original direction. At the age of two, having easily mastered the alphabet, he immediately learned to recite the letters in reverse. Neither was much of a challenge, since the order never changed, backward or forward.<br><br> Odder than each of these behaviors on its own was the fact that they were locked together in a distinct combination of deficits and talents. And yet this constellation of behaviors, which shaped Donald&#x2019;s personality so comprehensively and dramatically, had no name. For that reason, Donald&#x2019;s mother drew the only conclusion that made sense to her, relying on the only words she could think of. With regret and sorrow, she wrote a letter in which she confessed that her little boy was &#x201c;hopelessly insane.&#x201d; The diagnosis of &#x201c;autism&#x201d; had not yet been invented.<br><br> Mary Triplett, Donald&#x2019;s mother, was the one who would change that. She and Donald&#x2019;s father intended only to get help for their son, but in doing so, they set in motion a chain of events that would culminate in the discovery of autism in Donald, and the publication of the first internationally recognized description of the condition in a medical journal.<br><br> But before any of that could happen, Donald&#x2019;s parents would first have to undo a mistake they had made early and regretted almost immediately. They had to get him back home.<br><br> The last time the three of them had been together as a family had been just over a year earlier. They had been driving south out of Forest, a journey of about an hour ahead of them&#x2014;�two at most. But Donald, not quite four years old in that late summer of 1937, could not have been expected to understand what an hour feels like, much less guess that when the ride ended, his mother and father would disappear from his life altogether.<br><br> He was a boy who dreaded riding on or in moving objects. Tricycles provoked in him a mortal terror. He fled from swings. But ensconced between his parents in the front seat of the Buick, Donald could lean against his mother if he wanted to. True, he had never really cried for her, never fixed his gaze on her and shared a moment of tenderness. Not once during this ride would he look up at her and smile, and she knew that.<br><br> That was the hardest thing for Mary&#x2014;�Donald&#x2019;s utter emotional indifference to her presence. The boy beside her did not seem to care in the slightest whether she caressed or kissed or hugged him. If she were to turn away and face the open window, lost in her own thoughts, he would never cling or whimper to win back her attention. One of the most basic pleasures a parent feels&#x2014;�that of being loved&#x2014;�was completely unknown to her, even though the other young mothers in her circle took it for granted. Surely a child&#x2019;s love for his mother was instinctive, the conventional order of things. And if Mary knew one thing about herself, it was that she&#x2019;d always been most at home within the boundaries of the conventional, and had done surpassingly well there.<br><br> That was not to say that she was average. She had been raised to get the best out of life, with the superb advantage of being born to one of Forest&#x2019;s leading families, with more money and education than most of those around her. Not that there was much competition. Forest called itself a city, but really it had always been a small rural town. Even after knocking on every door in the community in 1930, census takers hadn&#x2019;t been able to count more than 3,000 souls. True, there was a lively enough downtown&#x2014;�a barbershop, a beauty salon, grocery and furniture stores, several churches, a courthouse, a railroad depot, and a public high school that served white children from Forest and surrounding towns.<br><br> The dropout rate at the school, however, was always a problem, as it would remain far into the future throughout Mississippi, where poverty, illiteracy, and a shorter-�than-�average life expectancy were the state&#x2019;s enduring triple curse. Despite the presence of two strong universities in Ole Miss and archrival Mississippi State, as well as a broad talent pool of doctors, lawyers, engineers, newspapermen, and some extraordinary artists and writers, there was a cultural and political inertia&#x2014;�a resistance to progress, a preference for the traditional ways.<br><br> Even when the civil rights movement finally reached Mississippi in the mid-�1960s, upending the status quo, the ferment came more slowly to Scott County, where Forest was located, and where &#x201c;Negroes&#x201d; generally had no opportunity to vote. As late as 1957, town elders pressed the Forest High School marching band to open a football game with &#x201c;Dixie&#x201d; instead of &#x201c;The Star Spangled Banner,&#x201d; which they described as the anthem of an oppressive new order. The school administration complied.<br><br> Mary was born a McCravey, granddaughter to J. R. McCravey, a founder of the Bank of Forest, which still operates today. Conservative Presbyterians, the McCraveys had little incentive to upset the social order, but her parents did have more sophisticated aspirations than raising yet another mildly educated Southern belle. They pulled Mary out of public school to send her to a private Presbyterian girls&#x2019; school fifty miles away in Jackson. A few years later, still in Jackson, she enrolled in Belhaven College, a school for Christian women.<br><br> She did well at Belhaven, where she was named business manager for the yearbook, elected senior class president, and awarded a bachelor&#x2019;s degree in English. Graduate school was an option, but Mary chose to move directly into teaching, one of the careers most welcoming to the nation&#x2019;s relatively few college-�educated women. She joined the English department of a public high school that prepared teenagers primarily for the farming life.<br><br> The next stage for her, it was clear, would be marriage, followed by motherhood. For the time being, she would keep working, but as with any single woman her age in Forest, her proper ambition during this phase in her life&#x2014;�which ideally should not run for too long&#x2014;�was to be courted.<br><br> She didn&#x2019;t have long to wait. Though not beautiful, she had an appealing confidence; her wavy bobbed hair, modest jewelry, and simple dresses signaled that she felt comfortable in her skin. And then, of course, her family owned that bank.<br><br> She had more than one suitor but settled finally for a local young man named Oliver Triplett. Known to everyone by his middle name, Beamon, he was the former mayor&#x2019;s son. He was active with Boy Scouts and regularly taught Sunday school at the Presbyterian church, where his sister was the organist. The unusual thing about Beamon was that he had left home to go north to complete his law studies at Yale, then come home again to open a one-�man practice in a corner office above a storefront facing the county courthouse.<br><br> Mary and Beamon exchanged vows on June 19, 1930. She was twenty-�five, and he was twenty-�seven. Donald was born a little more than three years later, on September 8, 1933.<br><br> They sensed nothing amiss in the beginning, but then, they had no previous experience to go by. Physically, Donald was perfectly normal; he learned to sit up and walk according to the usual timetable, and even talked a little early. A weathered family album shows a small baby and then a toddler, who does, on occasion, look directly into the camera. In one shot, taken when he was probably not yet one, his gaze appears as intently focused forward as that of his grandfather, on whose right arm he perches. In another, in which he appears to be about two, Donald stands alone in the family garden, his body turned away from the camera, his hands occupied with some sort of toy vehicle. But his face and eyes are turned toward the camera, with a smile that seems aimed at the photographer, as though an instant earlier he had heard his name called, and was now glancing back over his shoulder to see who was there.<br><br> The album shows the moments of connection becoming less frequent as Donald gets older. He smiles less, and a discomfort creeps in&#x2014;�a discomfort in being held, or made to sit still, or compelled to look &#x201c;natural&#x201d; with the parents and aunts and grandparents who stand near him in billowing blouses, bow ties, straw hats, and suspenders. In nearly every frame, everyone grins big and focuses their attention on the camera&#x2014;�everyone but Donald, who peers off in random directions, his bare arms and legs limp.<br><br> Mary had to admit to herself that Donald was not &#x201c;normal,&#x201d; whatever normal meant. Neither, any longer, was Mary&#x2019;s life as his mother. All her hours now belonged to Donald, even as he reached an age when children start to become more self-�sufficient. Well into his third year he still could not feed himself, so she was at his side at every meal, handing him the cup, raising the spoon to his mouth, cajoling him to eat. He had no common sense about danger, yet he grew ever more competent at putting himself into dangerous situations. He cou...</p><h2>The Quillan Games (7) (Pendragon)</h2><p><b>Let the Games Begin....</b><br> Quillan is a territory on the verge of destruction. The people have lost control of their own future and must struggle simply to survive. The only chance they have of finding a better life is by playing the Quillan Games. Hosted by a strange pair of game masters, Veego and LaBerge, the games are a mix of sport and combat. They use the people of Quillan as pawns for their amusement as they force them to enter competitions that range from physical battles, to impossible obstacle courses, to computer-driven tests of agility. To triumph in the games is to live the life of a king. To lose is to die. <br> <br> This is the dangerous and deadly situation Bobby Pendragon finds on Quillan. He quickly realizes that the only way to save this troubled territory is to beat Veego and LaBerge at their own games and dismantle their horrible fun house. But there is more at stake for Bobby. The prize for winning the Quillan Games may be discovering the truth of what it really means a Traveler.</p><p>D.J.

D.J. lives with his family in Southern California.D.J. MacHale ratchets up the tension in Book Seven of the addictive Pendragon series, and narrator William Dufris keeps perfect pace with the drama. Hero Bobby Pendragon is dropped into Quillan, a territory where games have deadly consequences. Dufris continues his solid voicings of the bemused, desperate, and warrior sides of Bobby. Each book adds new friends and foes whom Bobby must learn to trust or fight. Dufris masters them as quickly as they appear. He&#39;s at his strongest orchestrating the hollow-sounding, mesmerizing broadcasts of the ever-present games. Within those broadcasts, Dufris&#39;s portrayal of the deranged media personalities Veego and LaBerge are perfectly amusing and perfectly disturbing.

Two aspects stand out&#x2014;a quest for novelty and a desire for instant gratification.

Wondrous gifts: the ability--with a glance, a gesture, a word--to summon animals, bring forth fire, move the land. Fearsome gifts: They can twist a limb, chain a mind, inflict a wasting illness. The Uplanders live in constant fear that one family might unleash its gift against another. Two young people, friends since childhood, decide <i>not</i> to use their gifts. One, a girl, refuses to bring animals to their death in the hunt. The other, a boy, wears a blindfold lest his eyes and his anger kill.<br> <br>In this beautifully crafted story, Ursula K.

Yet in the end the lost man, the runaway man was our guide.<br><br> Gry called him the runaway man. When he first came, she was sure he'd done some terrible thing, a murder or a betrayal, and was escaping vengeance. What else would bring a Lowlander here, among us?<br><br> "Ignorance," I said. "He knows nothing of us. He's not afraid of us."<br><br> "He said people down there warned him not to come up among the witches."<br><br> "But he knows nothing about the gifts," I said. "It's all just talk, to him. Legends, lies..."<br><br> We were both right, no doubt. Certainly Emmon was running away, if only from a well-earned reputation for thievery, or from boredom; he was as restless, as fearless and inquisitive and inconsequential as a hound puppy, trotting wherever his nose led him. Recalling the accent and turns of speech he had, I know now that he came from far in the south, farther than Algalanda, where tales of the Uplands were just that-tales: old rumors of the distant northland, where wicked witchfolk lived in icy mountains and did impossible things.<br><br> If he'd believed what they told him down in Danner, he'd never have come up to Caspromant. If he'd believed us, he never would have gone on higher in the mountains. He loved to hear stories, so he listened to ours, but he didn't believe them. He was a city man, he'd had some education, he'd travelled the length of the Lowlands. He knew the world. Who were we, me and Gry? What did we know, a blind boy and a grim girl, sixteen years old, stuck in the superstition and squalor of the desolate hill farms that we so grandly called our domains? He led us on, in his lazy kindness, to talk about the great powers we had, but while we talked he was seeing the bare, hard way we lived, the cruel poverty, the cripples and backward people of the farms, seeing our ignorance of everything outside these dark hills, and saying to himself, Oh yes, what great powers they have, poor brats!<br><br> Gry and I feared that when he left us he went to Geremant. It is hard to think he may still be there, alive but a slave, with legs twisted like corkscrews, or his face made monstrous for Erroy's amusement, or his eyes truly blinded, as mine were not. For Erroy wouldn't have suffered his careless airs, his insolence, for an hour.<br><br> I took some pains to keep him away from my father when his tongue was flapping, but only because Canoc's patience was short and his mood dark, not because I feared he'd ever use his gift without good cause. In any case he paid little heed to Emmon or anyone else. Since my mother's death his mind was all given to grief and rage and rancor. He huddled over his pain, his longing for vengeance. Gry, who knew all the nests and eyries for miles around, once saw a carrion eagle brooding his pair of silvery, grotesque eaglets in a nest up on the Sheer, after a shepherd killed the mother bird who hunted for them both. So my father brooded and starved.<br><br> To Gry and me, Emmon was a treasure, a bright creature come into our gloom. He fed our hunger. For we were starving too.<br><br> He would never tell us enough about the Lowlands. He'd give an answer of some kind to every question I asked, but often a joking answer, evasive or merely vague. There was probably a good deal about his past life that he didn't want us to know, and anyhow he wasn't a keen observer and clear reporter, as Gry was when she was my eyes. She could describe exactly how the new bull calf looked, his bluish coat and knobby legs and little furry hornbuds, so that I could all but see him. But if I asked Emmon to tell about the city of Derris Water, all he said was that it wasn't much of a city and the market was dull. Yet I knew, because my mother had told me, that Derris Water had tall red houses and deep streets, that steps of slate led up from the docks and moorages where the river traffic came and went, that there was a market of birds, and a market of fish, and a market of spices and incense and honey, a market for old clothes and a market for new ones, and the great pottery fairs to which people came from all up and down the Trond River, even from the far shores of the ocean.<br><br> Maybe Emmon had had bad luck with his thieving in Derris Water.<br><br> Whatever the reason, he preferred to ask us the questions and sit back at ease to listen to us-to me, mostly. I was always a talker, if there was anybody to listen. Gry had a long habit of silence and watchfulness, but Emmon could draw her out.<br><br> I doubt he knew how lucky he'd been in finding us two, but he appreciated our making him welcome and keeping him comfortable through a bitter, rainy winter. He was sorry for us. He was bored, no doubt. He was inquisitive.<br><br> "So what is it this fellow up at Geremant does that's so fearsome?" he'd ask, his tone just skeptical enough that I'd try as hard as I could to convince him of the truth of what I said. But these were matters that were not much talked about, even among people with the gift. It seemed unnatural to speak of them aloud.<br><br> "The gift of that lineage is called the twisting," I said at last.<br><br> "Twisting? Like a sort of dancing?"<br><br> "No." The words were hard to find, and hard to say. "Twisting people."<br><br> "Making them turn around?"<br><br> "No. Their arms, legs. Necks. Bodies." I twisted my own body a bit with discomfort at the subject. Finally I said, "You saw old Gonnen, that woodsman, up over Knob Hill. We passed him yesterday on the cart road. Gry told you who he was."<br><br> "All bent over like a nutcracker."<br><br> "Brantor Erroy did that to him."<br><br> "Doubled him up like that? What for?"<br><br> "A punishment. The brantor said he came on him picking up wood in Gere Forest."<br><br> After a little, Emmon said, "Rheumatism will do that to a man."<br><br> "Gonnen was a young man then."<br><br> "So you don't yourself recall it happening."<br><br> "No," I said, vexed by his airy incredulity. "But he does. And my father does. Gonnen told him. Gonnen said he wasn't in Geremant at all, but only near the borderline, in our woods. Brantor Erroy saw him and shouted, and Gonnen was scared, and started to run away with the load of wood on his back. He fell. When he tried to stand, his back was bent over and hunched, the way it is now. If he tries to stand up, his wife said, he screams with the pain."<br><br> "And how did the brantor do this to him?"<br><br> Emmon had learned the word from us; he said he'd never heard it in the Lowlands. A brantor is the master or mistress of a domain, which is to say the chief and most gifted of a lineage. My father was Brantor of Caspromant. Gry's mother was Brantor of the Barres of Roddmant and her father Brantor of the Rodds of that domain. We two were their heirs, their nestling eaglets.<br><br> I hesitated to answer Emmon's question. His tone had not been mocking, but I didn't know if I should say anything at all about the powers of the gift.<br><br> Gry answered him. "He'd have looked at the man," she said in her quiet voice. In my blindness her voice always brought to me a sense of light air moving in the leaves of a tree. "And pointed his left hand or finger at him, and maybe said his name. And then he'd have said a word, or two, or more. And it was done."<br><br> "What kind of words?"<br><br> Gry was silent; maybe she shrugged. "The Gere gift's not mine," she said at last. "We don't know its ways."<br><br> "Ways?"<br><br> "The way a gift acts."<br><br> "Well, how does your gift act, what does it do, then?" Emmon asked her, not teasing, alive with curiosity. "It's something to do with hunting?"<br><br> "The Barre gift is calling," Gry said.<br><br> "Calling? What do you call?"<br><br> "Animals."<br><br>Copyright � 2004 by Ursula K.

Charles Moore&#39;s biography of Margaret Thatcher, published after her death on 8 April 2013, immediately supersedes all earlier books written about her. At the moment when she becomes a historical figure, this book also makes her into a three dimensional one for the first time. It gives unparalleled insight into her early life and formation, especially through her extensive correspondence with her sister, which Moore is the first author to draw on. It recreates brilliantly the atmosphere of British politics as she was making her way, and takes her up to what was arguably the zenith of her power, victory in the Falklands. (This volume ends with the Falklands Dinner in Downing Street in November 1982.) Moore is clearly an admirer of his subject, but he does not shy away from criticising her or identifying weaknesses and mistakes where he feels it is justified. Based on unrestricted access to all Lady Thatcher&#39;s papers, unpublished interviews with her and all her major colleagues, this is the indispensable, fully rounded portrait of a towering figure of our times.</p><p><p><b>Amazon Guest Review of &#x201c;Margaret Thatcher&#x201d;</b></p><p></p><p><b>By Anne Applebaum</b></p><p></p> <p><strong>Anne Applebaum is the author of several books, including <i>Iron Curtain: The Crushing of Eastern Europe</i>, a National Book Award finalist, and <i>Gulag: A History</i>, which won the 2004 Pulitzer Prize for general nonfiction. She writes a column for <i>The Washington Post</i> and <i>Slate</i>, and is the Director of Political Studies at the Legatum Institute in London. She divides her time between Britain and Poland, where her husband, Radek Sikorski, serves as Foreign Minister.</strong></p> <p>From the beginning she sounded different. She looked different too, particularly back when she had frizzy hair and wore too much jewelry...</p> <p>Much has happened since then. She became the Iron Lady, she became prime minister, she became a symbol to love or hate, she became an &#x201c;ism&#x201d;...We all think we know what happened to her and why&#x2014;but do we really?</p> <p>Moore&#x2019;s great gift is his ability to make Thatcher&#x2019;s story fresh again, and above all to remind us of how odd she was. By beginning at the beginning, by showing us the reality of the childhood we only know through clich�s&#x2014;&#x201c;grocer&#x2019;s daughter,&#x201d; &#x201c;scholarship girl&#x201d;&#x2014;by introducing us to the boyfriends we&#x2019;ve never met and by quoting from her chatty, breathless letters to her sister (&#x201c;I decided to buy a really nice undie-set to go under my turquoise chiffon blouse&#x201d;) Moore shows us how impossible it would have been for anyone who knew her as a young woman to imagine what she would become.</p> <p>He also captures her unsettling personality, her &#x201c;actressy&#x201d; manner, her stiffness in public, her private warmth, her inept outbursts and faux pas, almost always using the language of people who were there at the time. During the decade and a half he worked on this authorized biography&#x2014;of which this is only the first volume&#x2014;Moore had unprecedented access to her private papers, on condition that nothing be published until after her death. He interviewed just about everyone who knew Thatcher, from her private secretaries to her political enemies, and he did so meticulously. This enabled Moore to produce not a hagiography or a court biography, as some feared he would, but a multi-faceted picture of a compelling and unusual life.</p> <p>Moore is at his best when presenting different views of the same situation. Some of these contradictory impressions are explained by the fact that she was female in an almost entirely male world. In later years, many assumed she had no interest in other women or awareness of herself as a role model, but Moore shows over and over again that this was not the case.</p> <p>Her oddity was also connected to her brilliance, another one of her qualities now lost beneath layers of history and controversy. Thatcher got to Oxford from Grantham not because she had connections but because she worked incredibly hard, even overcoming objections from a teacher who told her to forget Oxford because &#x201c;you haven&#x2019;t got Latin.&#x201d; She said, &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll get Latin&#x201d; and went to take lessons from a Latin teacher at a local boy&#x2019;s school. Later, she passed the Bar exam after studying tax law on her own.</p> <p>The same autodidactic instinct impelled her to study economic and political theory. Although this is very much a narrative biography, it is also a thematic book about ideas: where they come from, how they affect people and how they get shaped into policies. And Thatcher proved unusually receptive to what were then very unfashionable ideas. In the summer of 1968, when the rest of the world was turning on and dropping out, she was in her suburban sitting room reading library books on Conservative political philosophy.</p> <p>In the end, this combination of biography and intellectual history works perfectly. After all, Thatcher&#x2019;s ideas were shaped by the place where she was born, by the people she met, by Oxford in the 1940s and Finchley in the 1950s, by her quirkiness and her brilliance, by her provinciality and her romantic choices. To understand what happened to Britain during her prime ministership and afterwards, it really is important to understand who she was: Moore&#x2019;s Thatcher will now become the definitive account.</p>Charles Moore joined the staff of the Daily Telegraph in 1979, and as a political columnist in the 1980s covered several years of Mrs Thatcher&#39;s first and second governments. He was Editor of the Spectator 1984-90; Editor of the Sunday Telegraph 1992-95; and Editor of the Daily Telegraph 1995-2003, for which he is still a regular columnist. The first volume of his biography of Margaret Thatcher, published in 2013, won the Elizabeth Longford Prize for Historical Biography, the HW Fisher Best First Biography Prize and Political Book of the Year at the Paddy Power Political Book Awards.</p><h2>The Star Trek The Next Generation Companion</h2><p><i>The Star Trek: The Next Generation� Companion</i> is the complete guide to the series that brought <i><i>Star Trek</i>�</i>� back to television for seven extremely successful seasons. Episode-by-episode summaries, credits, and behind-the-scenes notes that shed intriguing light on the production of the show. This edition is updated to include information on the film <i>Star Trek Generations</i>. Indexed by episode number, by writer, guest stars, and directors, it's the one book that brings all this information together between two covers.</p><p>Larry Nemecek is a widely respected expert on Star Trek who was for several years the editor of the US magazine Star Trek: Communicator. He is a consultant on the Star Trek Fact Files and is known to UK Star Trek fans for his regular column in Star Trek: Monthly in which he answers readers&#39; questions on all aspects of Star Trek.<b><i>Star Trek:</i> First Contact</b><p>In February 1995, word arrived from the studio to ready a new <i>Star Trek</i> feature for a 1996 holiday release. "We were standing outside on the Hart Building steps," Moore recalls. "Rick had just come back from that studio meeting, and Brannon and I were on our way out and Rick stopped us and he said, 'I really want you guys to think about it -- you don't have to -- I want to do a time-travel piece.' Brannon and I added, 'We want to do something with the Borg.' And right on the spot, we said maybe we can do both, the Borg and time travel."</p><p>Why the Borg? Moore felt that the Borg deserved the scope a feature-film budget would allow. "The Borg were really liked by the fans, and we liked them. They were fearsome. They were unstoppable. Perfect foils for a feature story."</p><p>Immediately it became clear that the time-travel element could play out as the Borg try to prevent humanity from ever reaching space. But when? Berman suggested the Renaissance: the Borg would prevent the dawning of modern European civilization.</p><p>In a story draft called <i>Star Trek: Renaissance,</i> the Borg are tracked by our crew to a castle basement and their colonizing hive. Moore explains, "And you would have sword fights and phaser fights mixed together, in fifteenth-century Europe." The Data story would have him signing on as the apprentice to Leonardo da Vinci. Of Renaissance Moore said, "It risked becoming really campy and over-the-top."</p><p>"The one image that I brought to the table," recalled Braga, "is the image of the Vulcans coming out of the ship. I wanted to see the birth of <i>Star Trek.</i> We ended up coming back to that moment. That, to me, is what made the time-travel story fresh. We get to see what happened, when humans shook hands with their first aliens."</p><p>As <i>Star Trek: Resurrection</i> took form it told the story of time travel, provided an encounter with the Borg, and centered around the discovery of warp drive by Dr. Zefram Cochrane. Taking cues from several TNG stories, it was decided to place Cochrane in the mid-twenty-first century, in a non-urban site. Montana fit with continuity, and happens to be Braga's home state. This first script has the Borg attacking Cochrane's lab, which leaves the scientist comatose; that forces Picard to assume Cochrane's place and launch the warp ship <i>Phoenix.</i> A local photographer and X-ray tech named Ruby becomes the key to rebuilding a destroyed warp component. Dr. Crusher battles to save Cochrane, while admiration blossoms into romance between Ruby and Picard. However, it is Riker who leads the defense of the <i>Enterprise</i> against the Borg.</p><p>To underline the ever-increasing horror of how fast the Borg were assimilating the <i>Enterprise</i> and its crew, the writers added a new insidious step to the process. Borg drones would inject a captured crew member, instantly making them part of the collective. However, early attempts to keep the collective faceless proved frustrating. "It always sounded better in concept than it was in trying to execute it dramatically," Moore recalled. After struggling to represent the Borg as a true collective, the writers knew they needed a single Borg character -- the hive needed a queen -- to serve as the focal point for dramatic interaction. </p><p>Taking an objective look, the trio knew their story required work. "The things that worked through both drafts were the Borg action stuff, Cochrane, the Vulcan landing, Data and the queen," Braga recalled. "It just didn't make sense to us," Moore said, "that Picard, the one guy who has a history with the Borg, never meets them. He was on the surface during this whole thing while the Borg are upstairs fighting Riker, et al." A simple swap of the two heroes was called for; Picard's story moved to the ship, and the planet-based story was trimmed and told with a different tone. "Let's get simple. Bring Cochrane into the story," Moore explained. "Let's make him an interesting fellow, and it could say something about the birth of the Federation. The future that Gene Roddenberry envisioned is born out of this very flawed man, who is not larger than life but an ordinary flawed human being."</p><p>The idea of Borg set against period costumes was moved to the holodeck in what was dubbed "the cocktail party." At Rick Berman's suggestion, it became a Dixon Hill scenario. All these changes coalesced in the second draft, which still carried the title <i>Star Trek: Resurrection.</i> This would be the script that the production team -- headed by Marty Hornstein and Peter Lauritson -- would use for a budget. </p><p>The first order of business was the creation of a new starship. That job was entrusted to production designer Herman Zimmerman. "The script says, 'The new <i>Enterprise</i> sleekly comes out of the nebula.' And that's about the only thing we had to go from," illustrator John Eaves explained. For Eaves, a longtime fan, it was a dream assignment. He combined the script's description with the mandate that this new <i>Enterprise</i> be larger than her predecessor and created a sleek, faster-looking ship with an oval saucer. "The <i>Enterprise</i>-E has only twenty-four decks, so it is smaller mass-wise than the 'D' but it's longer," he pointed out.</p><p>The new bridge reflected another description from the script: a single captain's chair, with all stations facing toward it. A slightly larger and much less spartan ready room was also created. Elements were carried over from the series: the Shakespeare volume and the captain's Mintakan tapestry draped over his ready-room chair ("Who Watches the Watchers?"/152).</p><p>However, the single set that carried over most of its grace notes from the series was the observation lounge. Its windows were the same ones that were used on the television show. Zimmerman returned to a look of the earlier seasons of the show, and placed a display of <i>Enterprise</i> vessels on the inner wall. Now the models were gold, three-dimensional, and encased in glass. Main engineering got a massive, three-story set, with corridors, a lobby, and the biggest warp core to date. Sickbay was a redress of <i>Voyager's</i> set, saving time and money. Worf's appearance on the Defiant bridge was filmed on the Deep Space Nine standing set. </p><p>The choice of director was one with "family" connections. Having tossed his hat in the ring with other directors, Jonathan Frakes won the assignment. "Not having directed a major motion picture before, I'm told I got the job about a month later than would have been ideal," Frakes commented. He named <i>TNG</i> and <i>Voyager</i> veteran Jerry Fleck as his first assistant director, Matt Leonetti as director of photography, and Jack Wheeler as film editor. Among the returning feature vets were set decorator John Dwyer, art director Ron Wilkinson, sound mixer Tom Causey, and live effects master Terry Frazee. Doubling up with their television work were casting directors Junie Lowry-Johnson and Ron Surma, construction coordinator Tom Arp, and script coordinator Lolita Fatjo. ILM would again tackle the bulk of visual effects under producer John Knoll. While some of the opticals went to local FX houses, this was headed by series visual effects coordinator David Takemura. </p><p>Bob Blackman, longtime costume designer for the series, would redesign the Starfleet uniform. To ease Blackman's workload -- he had two television series and now a feature -- non-Starfleet design was given to Deborah Everton. "I think I met them on a Thursday and that Monday I was at work!" Everton recalled. The burden for upgrading the Borg would fall jointly to her and veteran makeup designer Michael Westmore. The old pasty-white skin and salvaged costumes were largely unchanged since Season 2 ("Q Who?"/142). "I wanted it to look like they were Borgified from the inside out rather than the outside in," Everton said. The queen was their most difficult challenge. She had to be unique among Borg, but still retain human qualities. "It was very difficult," notes Westmore. "We didn't want somebody to come along and say, 'Oh, that looks like <i>Alien.'"</i></p><p>With the April 8 start date rapidly closing in, Berman and Frakes turned at last to casting. For Zefram Cochrane, Frakes chose James Cromwell. "In spite of having been nominated for an Academy Award, he actually came in and read for the part," Frakes said. "He nailed it. He left Berman and me with our jaws in our laps." For Lily Sloane, the choice was easy, Frakes recalled: "The first time we got through the script, I think everyone's first words were 'Alfre Woodard.'" Oscar nominated for <i>Cross Creek,</i> Woodard also had Emmys for guest-starring on <i>Hill Street Blues</i> and the <i>LA Law</i> pilot. Frakes revealed that the hardest to cast was the Borg queen. A London-trained South African native, Alice Krige, of <i>Chariots of Fire</i> and <i>Dream West,</i> would go on to create one of the <i>Star Trek</i> features' great villains.</p><p>Finally, the third-draft script added three surprises to the cast. A cameo by Dwight Schultz as Barclay, Robert Picardo as the <i>Enterprise</i>-E's Emergency Medical Hologram, and <i>Voyager</i> castmate Ethan Phillips in human guise as the maitre d' of the Dixon Hill holoprogram. </p><p>Weeks earlier, Resurrection had been abandoned as a title when Fox announced it as the name of their fourth Alien film. For a while the feature was called <i>Star Trek: Borg</i> and even <i>Star Trek: Generations II.</i> It was not until May 3 that the script appeared with its final title: <i>Star Trek: First Contact.</i></p><p>With so many new sets to build, plans called for filming to start with location shooting. Four days were planned at the Titan Missile Museum, south of Tucson, Arizona. The disarmed nuclear missile and subterranean silo would stand in for Cochrane's recycled <i>Phoenix</i> booster. <i>"That</i> was a challenge," recalls Frakes of filming in the silo. "It was incredible. It also was a set we couldn't have afforded to build." A fiberglass capsule shell -- the <i>Phoenix's</i> command module -- was fitted over the top of the rocket.</p><p>Two weeks of nighttime shooting in the Angeles National F...</p></p><h2>Naked in Death</h2><p>Eve Dallas, a New York police lieutenant, is in over her head when she breaks the rules and falls in love with Roarke, an Irish billionaire and a suspect in her most recent case, in a new hardcover edition of the first futuristic mystery featuring homicide detective Eve Dallas.

Through the slats on the window shades, the first murky hint of dawn slipped, slanting shadowy bars over the bed. It was like waking in a cell.</p><p>For a moment she simply lay there, shuddering, imprisoned, while the dream faded. After ten years on the force, Eve still had dreams.</p><p>Six hours before, she&#x2019;d killed a man, had watched death creep into his eyes. It wasn&#x2019;t the first time she&#x2019;d exercised maximum force, or dreamed. She&#x2019;d learned to accept the action and the consequences.</p><p>But it was the child that haunted her. The child she hadn&#x2019;t been in time to save. The child whose screams had echoed in the dreams with her own.</p><p>All the blood, Eve thought, scrubbing sweat from her face with her hands. Such a small little girl to have had so much blood in her. And she knew it was vital that she push it aside.</p><p>Standard departmental procedure meant that she would spend the morning in Testing. Any officer whose discharge of weapon resulted in termination of life was required to undergo emotional and psychiatric clearance before resuming duty. Eve considered the tests a mild pain in the ass.</p><p>She would beat them, as she&#x2019;d beaten them before.</p><p>When she rose, the overheads went automatically to low setting, lighting her way into the bath. She winced once at her reflection. Her eyes were swollen from lack of sleep, her skin nearly as pale as the corpses she&#x2019;d delegated to the ME.</p><p>Rather than dwell on it, she stepped into the shower, yawning.</p><p>&#x201c;Give me one oh one degrees, full force,&#x201d; she said and shifted so that the shower spray hit her straight in the face.</p><p>She let it steam, lathered listlessly while she played through the events of the night before. She wasn&#x2019;t due in Testing until nine, and would use the next three hours to settle and let the dream fade away completely.</p><p>Small doubts and little regrets were often detected and could mean a second and more intense round with the machines and the owl-eyed technicians who ran them.</p><p>Eve didn&#x2019;t intend to be off the streets longer than twenty-four hours.</p><p>After pulling on a robe, she walked into the kitchen and programmed her AutoChef for coffee, black; toast, light. Through her window she could hear the heavy hum of air traffic carrying early commuters to offices, late ones home. She&#x2019;d chosen the apartment years before because it was in a heavy ground and air pattern, and she liked the noise and crowds. On another yawn, she glanced out the window, followed the rattling journey of an aging airbus hauling laborers not fortunate enough to work in the city or by home-links.</p><p>She brought the <i>New York Times</i> up on her monitor and scanned the headlines while the faux caffeine bolstered her system. The AutoChef had burned her toast again, but she ate it anyway, with a vague thought of springing for a replacement unit.</p><p>She was frowning over an article on a mass recall of droid cocker spaniels when her tele-link blipped. Eve shifted to communications and watched her commanding officer flash onto the screen.</p><p>&#x201c;Commander.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Lieutenant.&#x201d; He gave her a brisk nod, noted the still wet hair and sleepy eyes. &#x201c;Incident at Twenty-seven West Broadway, eighteenth floor. You&#x2019;re primary.&#x201d;</p><p>Eve lifted a brow. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m on Testing. Subject terminated at twenty-two thirty-five.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;We have override,&#x201d; he said, without inflection. &#x201c;Pick up your shield and weapon on the way to the incident. Code Five, lieutenant.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, sir.&#x201d; His face flashed off even as she pushed back from the screen. Code Five meant she would report directly to her commander, and there would be no unsealed interdepartmental reports and no cooperation with the press.</p><p>In essence, it meant she was on her own.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Broadway was noisy and crowded, a party where rowdy guests never left. Street, pedestrian, and sky traffic were miserable, choking the air with bodies and vehicles. In her old days in uniform she remembered it as a hot spot for wrecks and crushed tourists who were too busy gaping at the show to get out of the way.</p><p>Even at this hour there was steam rising from the stationary and portable food stands that offered everything from rice noodles to soydogs for the teeming crowds. She had to swerve to avoid an eager merchant on his smoking Glida-Grill, and took his flipped middle finger as a matter of course.</p><p>Eve double-parked and, skirting a man who smelled worse than his bottle of brew, stepped onto the sidewalk. She scanned the building first, fifty floors of gleaming metal that knifed into the sky from a hilt of concrete. She was propositioned twice before she reached the door.</p><p>Since this five-block area of Broadway was affectionately termed Prostitute&#x2019;s Walk, she wasn&#x2019;t surprised. She flashed her badge for the uniform guarding the entrance.</p><p>&#x201c;Lieutenant Dallas.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, sir.&#x201d; He skimmed his official compu-seal over the door to keep out the curious, then led the way to the bank of elevators. &#x201c;Eighteenth floor,&#x201d; he said when the doors swished shut behind them.</p><p>&#x201c;Fill me in, officer.&#x201d; Eve switched on her recorder and waited.</p><p>&#x201c;I wasn&#x2019;t first on the scene, lieutenant. Whatever happened upstairs is being kept upstairs. There&#x2019;s a badge inside waiting for you. We have a Homicide, and a Code Five in number Eighteen-oh-three.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Who called it in?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t have that information.&#x201d;</p><p>He stayed where he was when the elevator opened. Eve stepped out and was alone in a narrow hallway. Security cameras tilted down at her and her feet were almost soundless on the worn nap of the carpet as she approached 1803. Ignoring the handplate, she announced herself, holding her badge up to eye level for the peep cam until the door opened.</p><p>&#x201c;Dallas.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Feeney.&#x201d; She smiled, pleased to see a familiar face. Ryan Feeney was an old friend and former partner who&#x2019;d traded the street for a desk and a top level position in the Electronics Detection Division. &#x201c;So, they&#x2019;re sending computer pluckers these days.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;They wanted brass, and the best.&#x201d; His lips curved in his wide, rumpled face, but his eyes remained sober. He was a small, stubby man with small, stubby hands and rust colored hair. &#x201c;You look beat.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Rough night.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;So I heard.&#x201d; He offered her one of the sugared nuts from the bag he habitually carried, studying her, and measuring if she was up to what was waiting in the bedroom beyond.</p><p>She was young for her rank, barely thirty, with wide brown eyes that had never had a chance to be naive. Her doe-brown hair was cropped short, for convenience rather than style, but suited her triangular face with its razor-edge cheekbones and slight dent in the chin.</p><p>She was tall, rangy, with a tendency to look thin, but Feeney knew there were solid muscles beneath the leather jacket. More, there was a brain, and a heart.</p><p>&#x201c;This one&#x2019;s going to be touchy, Dallas.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I picked that up already. Who&#x2019;s the victim?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Sharon DeBlass, granddaughter of Senator DeBlass.&#x201d;</p><p>Neither meant anything to her. &#x201c;Politics isn&#x2019;t my forte, Feeney.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The gentleman from Virginia, extreme right, old money. The granddaughter took a sharp left a few years back, moved to New York, and became a licensed companion.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;She was a hooker.&#x201d; Dallas glanced around the apartment. It was furnished in obsessive modern&#x2014;glass and thin chrome, signed holograms on the walls, recessed bar in bold red. The wide mood screen behind the bar bled with mixing and merging shapes and colors in cool pastels.</p><p>Neat as a virgin, Eve mused, and cold as a whore. &#x201c;No surprise, given her choice of real estate.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Politics makes it delicate. Victim was twenty-four, Caucasian female. She bought it in bed.&#x201d;</p><p>Eve only lifted a brow. &#x201c;Seems poetic, since she&#x2019;d been bought there. How&#x2019;d she die?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s the next problem. I want you to see for yourself.&#x201d;</p><p>As they crossed the room, each took out a slim container, sprayed their hands front and back to seal in oils and fingerprints. At the doorway, Eve sprayed the bottom of her boots to slicken them so that she would pick up no fibers, stray hairs, or skin.</p><p>Eve was already wary. Under normal circumstances there would have been two other investigators on a homicide scene, with recorders for sound and pictures. Forensics would have been waiting with their usual snarly impatience to sweep the scene.</p><p>The fact that only Feeney had been assigned with her meant that there were a lot of eggshells to be walked over.</p><p>&#x201c;Security cameras in the lobby, elevator, and hallways,&#x201d; Eve commented.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve already tagged the discs.&#x201d; Feeney opened the bedroom door and let her enter first.</p><p>It wasn&#x2019;t pretty. Death rarely was a peaceful, religious experience to Eve&#x2019;s mind. It was the nasty end, indifferent to saint and sinner. But this was shocking, like a stage deliberately set to offend.</p><p>The bed was huge, slicked with what appeared to be genuine satin sheets the color of ripe peaches. Small, soft focused spotlights were trained on its center where the naked woman was cupped in the gentle dip of the floating mattress.</p><p>The mattress moved with obscenely graceful undulations to the rhythm of programmed music slipping through the headboard.</p><p>She was beautiful still, a cameo face with a tumbling waterfall of flaming red hair, emerald eyes that stared glassily at the mirrored ceiling, long, milk white limbs that called to mind visions of <i>Swan Lake</i> as the motion of the bed gently rocked them.</p><p>They weren&#x2019;t artistically arranged now, but spread lewdly so that the dead woman formed a final X dead center of the bed.</p><p>There was a hole in her forehead, one in her chest, another horribly gaping between the open thighs. Blood had splattered on the glossy sheets, pooled, dripped, and stained.</p><p>There were splashes of it on the lacquered walls, like lethal paintings scrawled by an evil child.</p><p>So much blood was a rare thing, and she had seen much too much of it the night before to take the scene as calmly as she would have preferred.</p><p>She had to swallow once, hard, and force herself to block out the image of a small child.</p><p>&#x201c;You got the scene on record?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yep.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Then turn that damn thing off.&#x201d; She let out a breath after Feeney located the controls that silenced the music. The bed flowed to stillness. &#x201c;The wounds,&#x201d; Eve murmured, stepping closer to examine them. &#x201c;Too neat for a knife. Too messy for a laser.&#x201d; A flash came to her&#x2014;old training films, old videos, old viciousness.</p><p>&#x201c;Christ, Feeney, these look like bullet wounds.&#x201d;</p><p>Feeney reached into his pocket and drew out a sealed bag. &#x201c;Whoever did it left a souvenir.&#x201d; He passed the bag to Eve. &#x201c;An antique like this has to go for eight, ten thousand for a legal collection, twice that on the black market.&#x201d;</p><p>Fascinated, Eve turned the sealed revolver over in her hand. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s heavy,&#x201d; she said half to herself. &#x201c;Bulky.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Thirty-eight caliber,&#x201d; he told her. &#x201c;First one I&#x2019;ve seen outside of a museum. This one&#x2019;s a Smith &amp; Wesson, Model Ten, blue steel.&#x201d; He looked at it with some affection. &#x201c;Real classic piece, used to be standard police issue up until the latter part of the twentieth. They stopped making them in about twenty-two, twenty-three, when the gun ban was passed.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re the history buff.&#x201d; Which explained why he was with her. &#x201c;Looks new.&#x201d; She sniffed through the bag, caught the scent of oil and burning. &#x201c;Somebody took good care of this. Steel fired into flesh,&#x201d; she mused as she passed the bag back to Feeney. &#x201c;Ugly way to die, and the first I&#x2019;ve seen it in my ten years with the department.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Second for me. About fifteen years ago, Lower East Side, party got out of hand. Guy shot five people with a twenty-two before he realized it wasn&#x2019;t a toy. Hell of a mess.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Fun and games,&#x201d; Eve murmured. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll scan the collectors, see how many we can locate who own one like this. Somebody might have reported a robbery.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Might have.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s more likely it came through the black market.&#x201d; Eve glanced back at the body. &#x201c;If she&#x2019;s been in the business for a few years, she&#x2019;d have discs, records of her clients, her trick books.&#x201d; She frowned. &#x201c;With Code Five, I&#x2019;ll have to do the door-to-door myself. Not a simple sex crime,&#x201d; she said with a sigh. &#x201c;Whoever did it set it up. The antique weapon, the wounds themselves, almost ruler straight down the body, the lights, the pose. Who called it in, Feeney?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The killer.&#x201d; He waited until her eyes came back to him. &#x201c;From right here. Called the station. See how the bedside unit&#x2019;s aimed at her face? That&#x2019;s what came in. Video, no audio.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s into showmanship.&#x201d; Eve let out a breath. &#x201c;Clever bastard, arrogant, cocky. He had sex with her first. I&#x2019;d bet my badge on it. Then he gets up and does it.&#x201d; She lifted her arm, aiming, lowering it as she counted off, &#x201c;One, two, three.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s cold,&#x201d; murmured Feeney.</p><p>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s cold. He smooths down the sheets after. See how neat they are? He arranges her, spreads her open so nobody can have any doubts as to how she made her living. He does it carefully, practically measuring, so that she&#x2019;s perfectly aligned. Center of the bed, arms and legs equally apart. Doesn&#x2019;t turn off the bed &#x2019;cause it&#x2019;s part of the show. He leaves the gun because he wants us to know right away he&#x2019;s no ordinary man. He&#x2019;s got an ego. He doesn&#x2019;t want to waste time letting the body be discovered eventually. He wants it now. That instant gratification.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;She was licensed for men and women,&#x201d; Feeney pointed out, but Eve shook her head.</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not a woman. A woman wouldn&#x2019;t have left her looking both beautiful and obscene. No, I don&#x2019;t think it&#x2019;s a woman. Let&#x2019;s see what we can find. Have you gone into her computer yet?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No. It&#x2019;s your case, Dallas. I&#x2019;m only authorized to assist.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;See if you can access her client files.&#x201d; Eve went to the dresser and began to carefully search drawers.</p><p>Expensive taste, Eve reflected. There were several items of real silk, the kind no simulation could match. The bottle of scent on the dresser was exclusive, and smelled, after a quick sniff, like expensive sex.</p><p>The contents of the drawers were meticulously ordered, lingerie folded precisely, sweaters arranged according to color and material. The closet was the same.</p><p>Obviously the victim had a love affair with clothes and a taste for the best and took scrupulous care of what she owned.</p><p>And she&#x2019;d died naked.</p><p>&#x201c;Kept good records,&#x201d; Feeney called out. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s all here. Her client list, appointments&#x2014;including her required monthly health exam and her weekly trip to the beauty salon. She used the Trident Clinic for the first and Paradise for the second.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Both top of the line. I&#x2019;ve got a friend who saved for a year so she could have one day for the works at Paradise. Takes all kinds.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;My wife&#x2019;s sister went for it for her twenty-fifth anniversary. Cost damn near as much as my kid&#x2019;s wedding. Hello, we&#x2019;ve got her personal address book.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Good. Copy all of it, will you, Feeney?&#x201d; At his low whistle, she looked over her shoulder, glimpsed the small gold-...</p></p><h2>The Adventure of English: The Biography of a Language</h2><p>A history of the English language traces its evolution from a gutteral Germanic dialect around 500 A.D. to its modern global form, noting the influence of such groups and individuals as the early Anglo-Saxon tribes, Alfred the Great, and William Shakespeare. 75,000 first printing.</p><p><b>Melvyn Bragg</b> is an English broadcaster and the author of more than a dozen novels, including <i>The Cumbrian Trilogy</i> and the Soldier&#x2019;s Return Quartet, as well as numerous works of nonfiction. <i>The Soldier&#x2019;s Return</i> won the WH Smith Literary Award as best novel of the year in 2000. In 1998 Bragg was named a life peer.This compelling and charmingly personal companion to an eight-part television documentary (scheduled for the fall) makes for an idiosyncratic rival to PBS's bestselling blockbuster <i>The Story of English</i>, by Robert McCrum et al<i>.</i> Titling a history of the evolution and expansion of a language an "adventure" presupposes a hero, with such obvious choices as Alfred the Great, for defeating the Danes; Chaucer, for his <i>Canterbury Tales</i>; Shakespeare, for his poetic inventiveness; or Samuel Johnson, for his groundbreaking dictionary. Bragg, a British TV and radio personality and novelist (<i>The Soldier's Return</i>), gives all their contributions their due, but English itself, with its "deep obstinacy" and "astonishing flexibility," emerges as his favorite character. Bragg's enthusiasm for his subject-hero, whether the Old English of <i>Beowulf </i>or the new "Text English" of the Internet, makes up for his shortcomings as a linguist: his sources, unfootnoted, are at times at variance with the OED or Webster's Third. For instance, Bragg furnishes only one putative origin for the disputed "real McCoy." Moreover "candy" does not seem to have Anglo-Indian origins (it's from the Arabic "qandi"), and the first recorded use of "vast" is not from Shakespeare (the OED cites Archbishop Edwin Sandys). Nevertheless, this "biography" succeeds in its broad, sweeping narrative, carrying the reader from the origins of Anglo-Saxon through the Viking and Norman invasions to the consolidation of "British" English and outward to America, Australia, India, the West Indies and beyond. After some 1,500 years, with one billion speakers now worldwide, according to Bragg, the English language has displayed an amazing ability to repair and reinvent itself, as Bragg ably shows. 32 pages of color illus. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

At the age of nineteen he walked to London and then traveled on foot through Spain as described in <i>As I Walked Out One Midsummer Morning</i>. He married Catherine Polge and had one daughter; he died in 1997.Originally published in 1969, Lee's charming account of his travels in Spain in 1935 became almost as popular as his delightful Cider with Rosie. This fussily illustrated edition is an insult to an enjoyable prose work by a distinguished poet. Rather than eliciting the Spain that Lee visited, these old-fashioned illustrations from a variety of sources detract from a text that is rendered unreadable by a 34-pica measure, surmounted by running headlines (finically set in caps and italic initial caps), topped by a double line that serves as "walking" surface for a little man with stick (presumably representing the author) who promenades remorselessly across the page, pica by pica, as the reader progresses with the story. Each color illustration is surrounded by a white mat-like area enclosed, in turn, by a triple-rule frame set against a tan backgrounda tacky effect.

He is the literary editor of the <i>Observer</i> and lives in London.In his authoritative biography of P.G. Wodehouse (1881&#x2013;1975), British author McCrum (<i>My Year Off</i>), literary editor of the <i>Observer,</i> rightly identifies the crisis over the great, if na�ve, English humorist's 1941 radio broadcasts from Germany (which led to accusations of his being a "Nazi stooge") as "the defining moment of Wodehouse's life." While the broadcasts and their aftermath get the most scrutiny, McCrum ably surveys a 75-year writing career that began in 1900 and ended only with Wodehouse's death at 93. He succinctly covers all the major topics&#x2014;Wodehouse's creation of the immortal Jeeves and Wooster; his triumphs as a lyricist for the musical theater; his frustrating stints as a scriptwriter in Hollywood; his tax troubles; his love of animals; his post-WWII U.S. exile; his long and successful, if apparently sexless, marriage. McCrum is franker on this latter subject than previous biographers and also dispels a myth or two. While Wodehouse largely left his financial affairs to his wife, Ethel, "in important literary business Wodehouse was always clinically decisive." When his new literary agent, Paul Reynolds Jr., wasn't successful, he fired him. Earlier studies have tended to be partisan or personal and stronger on some aspects of Wodehouse's varied life than others. For balance and readability, this popular biography, like Jeeves, stands alone. 16 pages of illus. not seen by <i>PW</i>. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

It is said that this 500-mile path lies directly under the Milky Way and that it reflects the energy of the star systems above it. Facing her sixth decade of life on earth, writer and actor Shirley MacLaine decided to go on this trek. She wasn't sure why, she only knew that the Camino had been traveled for thousands of years by "saints, sinners, generals, misfits, kings and queens. It is done by the intent to find one's deepest spiritual meaning and resolutions regarding conflicts in Self."<p> Typical of MacLaine, this is a personal story with enormous adventure, a smattering of flashbacks, and a hefty serving of cosmic revelations. Like a true pilgrim, MacLaine travels solo, willing to strip herself down to the backpacking essentials and find deeper meaning in all the bizarre, frightening, and coincidental events she encounters along the way. It is no small feat that this sixtysomething woman walked the grueling path in 30 days. Readers can expect vivid stories of stalking paparazzi, icy showers, bouts of hunger, lost paths, a worshipping young man, a deranged woman screaming in a roadside shelter, saintly truck drivers, a fellow pilgrim in a wheelchair, bouts of constipation and diarrhea, and a cosmic crescendo that will knock the socks of MacLaine's fans. <i>--Gail Hudson</i></p><b>Shirley MacLaine,</b> Oscar�-, three-time Emmy�-, and ten-time Golden Globe?-winning actress, has appeared in more than fifty films, been nominated for an Academy Award six times, and received the Oscar for Best Actress in 1984.

Surprise follows the variable fortunes of Captain Jack Aubrey's career in Nelson's navy as he attempts to hold his ground against admirals, colleagues and the enemy, accepting a mission to convey a British ambassador to the East Indies. The voyage takes him and his friend Stephen Maturin to the strange sights and smells of the Indian sub-continent, and through the archipelago of spice islands where the French have a near-overwhelming superiority.</p><p>Rarely has a novel managed to convey more vividly the fragility of a sailing ship in a wild sea. Rarely has a historical novelist combined action and lyricism of style in the way that O' Brian does. His superb sense of place, brilliant characterisation, and a vigour and joy of writing lift O'Brian above any but the most exalted of comparisons.</p></p><p>The stakes are high as <i>HMS Surprise</i> opens, and actor Robert Hardy's sterling reading never lets you forget them. Hardy makes Patrick O'Brian's third novel of high-seas adventure--written in 1973 and set mainly in 1805 on the waters surrounding India and the Orient--seem as immediate as an overdrawn checking account. Money plays a big role, and Captain Jack Aubrey stands to make a lot of it. All he has to do is find Napoleon's fleet--and take their gold away from them.

There she witnessed the full impact of the war and first formed the ambition to write an account of what history - the great political events driven by men of power, wealth, and ambition - does when it reaches the realm of ordinary people struggling for life and bread.<br><br> The central character in this powerful and unforgiving novel is Ida Mancuso, a schoolteacher whose husband has died and whose feckless teenage son treats the war as his playground. A German soldier on his way to North Africa rapes her, falls in love with her, and leaves her pregnant with a boy whose survival becomes Ida's passion. <br><br> Around these two other characters come and go, each caught up by the war which is like a river in flood. We catch glimpses of bombing raids, street crimes, a cattle car from which human cries emerge, an Italian soldier succumbing to frostbite on the Russian front, the dumb endurance of peasants who have lived their whole lives with nothing and now must get by with less than nothing.</p><p>Elsa Morante was born in 1912 and raised in Rome. In 1941 she married the prominent author Alberto Moravia, whose anti-Fascist reputation forced them to flee the German occupation and hide in the mountains until the Liberation. During this time Morante began to write her first novel, <i>House of Liars</i>. She would complete three more major works during her career, winning the Premio Strega in 1957 for <i>Arturo's Island</i>. Her final novel, <i>Aracoeli</i>, earned her the Prix Medicis Etranger in 1985, the year of her death.Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: Italian</p><h2>ARRL&#39;s Wire Antenna Classics</h2><p>-- A collection of the best articles from ARRL publications<br>So many wire antenna designs have proven to be first class performers!

Paul Costanzo gives voice to the male characters, providing clear distinction between the players. He portrays Agent Savich with a take-charge voice and a hint of subtle sensuality. Joyce Bean provides each of the female characters, including Agent Sherlock, with a uniqueness that is almost impossible for a sole narrator to achieve. Sherlock has a confident voice, and Rachael, the senator&#39;s illegitimate daughter, has lilting Southern tones that highlight the resilience beneath her quiet demeanor. As Rachael continues to be the target of a killer, both the narrators&#39; voices reflect the rising tension.

Most books on the Revolution focus on generals and kings, although scholars have, in the last two decades, turned some of their attention to the lives of ordinary people. Raphael transforms the best insights of that scholarship into a lively, readable narrative. Yes, kings and generals were important, but it was the people at large who brought about American independence. Even before the war started, ordinary people were involved in protesting British abuses, refusing to consume tea and other British luxury items. Women supported the Revolution by spinning their own cloth (rather than buying it from Britain) and working the farms their husbands left behind when the militia called them to the front. Young men eager to "git" their rights uncomplainingly subsisted on moldy bread while they camped out in the snow, waiting to encounter Redcoats. White colonists weren't the only Americans affected by the war. Abenaki Indians, for example, were paid to fight alongside the rebels. Raphael also shows how many slaves, infected with the freedom-fighting spirit, bid unsuccessfully for their own independence via insurrections, escape and reasoning. Both English and American armies wanted the slaves' loyalties, and the slaves, in turn, believed that if they served the winning side, they would gain freedom. Moving from broad overviews to stories of small groups or individuals, Raphael's study is impressive in both its sweep and its attention to the particular. The book will delight, educate and entertain all Revolution buffs. (Apr.) <br>Copyright 2001 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The M.O.P. Book: Anthology Edition: A Guide to the Only Proven Way to STOP Bedwetting and Accidents (black-and-white version)</h2><p>The M.O.P. Book: Anthology Edition is the updated and vastly expanded second edition of The M.O.P. Book, a groundbreaking manual for resolving bedwetting (nocturnal enuresis), daytime pee accidents (enuresis), and poop accidents (encopresis). Triple the length of the first edition, the new volume is for parents who are tired of waiting for their child to &#x201c;outgrow&#x201d; accidents &#x2014; who think they have &#x201c;tried everything.&#x201d; The pediatric urology team at Mayo Clinic calls M.O.P. &#x201c;incredibly effective.&#x201d; Parents call it &#x201c;life changing&#x201d; and &#x201c;a life saver.&#x201d; If your family is worn out from your child&#x2019;s struggles with accidents, you will be grateful for The M.O.P. Book: Anthology Edition. M.O.P. stands for the Modified O&#x2019;Regan Protocol, a regimen named for Sean O&#x2019;Regan, M.D., a pioneer in bedwetting research. The four-phase regimen, based on a combination of enemas and laxatives, has been modified by pediatric urologist Steve Hodges, M.D., of Wake Forest University School of Medicine. Published research shows M.O.P. is the only reliable solution to bedwetting and daytime accidents &#x2014; far more effective than medication, bedwetting alarms, or Miralax. M.O.P. is based on a simple, proven fact: bedwetting is caused by chronic, severe constipation. Stool piles up in the rectum, pressing against the bladder; only when the rectum is cleared out on a daily basis can it shrink back to size and stop aggravating the bladder. The M.O.P. Book: Anthology Edition not only updates the first edition, offering Dr. Hodges&#x2019; revised recommendations in great detail, but also includes an entire second book, Answers to 52 Questions About M.O.P. formerly sold only as an ebook on the author&#x2019;s website. The anthology also includes tracking calendars for parents and children, safety guidelines and step-by-step instructions, plus &#x201c;The Physician&#x2019;s Guide to M.O.P,&#x201d; created for parents to hand to their medical professionals. The Anthology Edition offers new insight into: �collaborating with your doctor and your child �adjusting the protocol if your child is not progressing �minimizing the odds of relapse �managing M.O.P. on vacation The M.O.P. Book: Anthology Edition builds on Dr. Hodges&#x2019; acclaimed first book, It&#x2019;s No Accident, also written with veteran health and parenting author Suzanne Schlosberg.

In spite of all the effort that choirmaster Mostyn Phillips puts in to the choir, it is not exactly first class. Hope arrives in the form of world renowned tenor Ifor Llewelyn, come home to Llanfair to rest, on doctor's orders. <br><br>Llewelyn immediately sets about renewing old friendships, and Mostyn even persuades him to sing with the choir. But Ifor isn't in Llanfair long before the residents decide that his presence is a mixed blessing. Noisy fights between Ifor and his wife, a threatening stranger, and Ifor's own warped sense of humor make life in Llanfair increasingly tense. When he announces that he is planning to write his memoirs, telling all about his numerous relationships with famous and infamous women, he jokes that some people won't be happy. But is someone unhappy enough to commit murder to stop him? While tracking down a dangerous killer, Constable Evans also manages to navigate the treacherous waters of neighborhood rivalries, lusty barmaids, and local gossip. <br><br>With her third book in this acclaimed series, Rhys Bowen offers another page-turning tale of small-town mayhem and murder. <br></p><p>Rhys Bowen is the New York Times bestselling author of more than thirty mystery novels.

Her books have been translated into many languages, and she has fans around the world, including twelve thousand Facebook followers. A transplanted Brit, Bowen divides her time between California and Arizona.Welsh Constable Evan Evans is conscripted to sing tenor in the town of Llanfair's male choir in the third book (after Evan Help Us) of Bowen's charming series. Soon after his first rehearsal, Evan and the other singers learn that world-famous operatic tenor Ifor Llewellyn will be returning home to Llanfair, renting out a clegyman's house. Before the great man's arrival, Evan overhears two strangers, male and female, fighting on the reverend's lawn. Later, when the young woman's car slides into a nearby lake, Evan saves her from drowning and gives her a lecture on attempted suicide. Before Evan can sort out these puzzling events, Ifor moves in. He delights the villagers by offering, as a favor to the choirmaster, with whom he roomed at college, to sing with the choir at the annual country-wide competition. But Ifor's vicious temperament and his volatile arguments with his wife leave the village perplexed. After Ifor misses an important rehearsal, Evan accompanies the choirmaster to visit the tempermental starAand finds his body in the drawing room. A bump on Ifor's head suggests an accidental fall, but an autopsy confirms Evan's suspicion that the man was murdered. Teaming up with his old friend Sergeant Watkins, the constable takes a close look at Ifor's private life, uncovering a neglected wife, a cast-aside lover, an angry son and a disdainful daughter. Between his singing debut and his bumpy romance with the town schoolteacher, Evan sorts through a humorous series of false confessions to catch the real killer. Picareque town characters compensate for the novel's lack of suspense and contrived plotting. Ultimately, it's Bowen's keen sense of small-town politics and gossip that will keep her fans turning pages. <br>Copyright 1999 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Belief: Readings on the Reason for Faith</h2><p><p>&#x201c;A brilliant, wide ranging and powerful series of readings on the possibilities, problems and mysteries of faith.

In the words of Socrates, the key to a fully mature and richly rewarding life, both for us as individuals and as a society, is to &#x2018;follow the argument wherever it leads,' unafraid of the consequences.

In contrast to his counterpart Cousin Bette, who seeks revenge against those who have humiliated her, Cousin Pons suffers passively as his health deteriorates and he eventually dies.

In the nineteenth century Americans (in addition to whatever specific ethnic, class, and regional cultures they were part of) shared a public culture less hierarchically organized, less fragmented into relatively rigid adjectival groupings than their descendants were to experience. By the twentieth century this cultural eclecticism and openness became increasingly rare. Cultural space was more sharply defined and less flexible than it had been. The theater, once a microcosm of America&#x2015;housing both the entire spectrum of the population and the complete range of entertainment from tragedy to farce, juggling to ballet, opera to minstrelsy&#x2015;now fragmented into discrete spaces catering to distinct audiences and separate genres of expressive culture. The same transition occurred in concert halls, opera houses, and museums. A growing chasm between &#x201c;serious&#x201d; and &#x201c;popular,&#x201d; between &#x201c;high&#x201d; and &#x201c;low&#x201d; culture came to dominate America&#x2019;s expressive arts.</p><p>&#x201c;If there is a tragedy in this development,&#x201d; Lawrence Levine comments, &#x201c;it is not only that millions of Americans were now separated from exposure to such creators as Shakespeare, Beethoven, and Verdi, whom they had enjoyed in various formats for much of the nineteenth century, but also that the rigid cultural categories, once they were in place, made it so difficult for so long for so many to understand the value and importance of the popular art forms that were all around them. Too many of those who considered themselves educated and cultured lost for a significant period&#x2015;and many have still not regained&#x2015;their ability to discriminate independently, to sort things out for themselves and understand that simply because a form of expressive culture was widely accessible and highly popular it was not therefore necessarily devoid of any redeeming value or artistic merit.&#x201d;</p><p>In this innovative historical exploration, Levine not only traces the emergence of such familiar categories as highbrow and lowbrow at the turn of the century, but helps us to understand more clearly both the process of cultural change and the nature of culture in American society.</p></p><p>&#39;Provides just the kind of balanced, historically informed assessment that can be of immediate value at a time when appeals to eternal truth fly thick and fast.&#39;Lawrence W. Levine was an American historian noted for promoting multiculturalism and the perspectives of ordinary people in the study of history.</p><h2>John of the Cross: Selected Writings (Classics of Western Spirituality (Paperback))</h2><p>This volume contains carefully chosen texts that give a picture of the &#34;essential&#34; St. John of the Cross (1542-1591), a Spanish Carmelite.

In this brilliant and expansive book, David Abulafia offers a fresh perspective by focusing on the sea itself: its practical importance for transport and sustenance; its dynamic role in the rise and fall of empires; and the remarkable cast of characters-sailors, merchants, migrants, pirates, pilgrims-who have crossed and re-crossed it. <br><br>Ranging from prehistory to the 21st century, <em>The Great Sea</em> is above all a history of human interaction. Interweaving major political and naval developments with the ebb and flow of trade, Abulafia explores how commercial competition in the Mediterranean created both rivalries and partnerships, with merchants acting as intermediaries between cultures, trading goods that were as exotic on one side of the sea as they were commonplace on the other. He stresses the remarkable ability of Mediterranean cultures to uphold the civilizing ideal of <em>convivencia</em>, "living together." <br><br>Now available in paperback, <em>The Great Sea</em> is the definitive account of perhaps the most vibrant theater of human interaction in history.<br></p><p><strong>Amazon Best Books of the Month, October 2011:</strong> In this expansive yet detailed historical gem, David Abulafia covers the full course of human history on the Mediterranean. Beginning more than 20,000 years ago with Cro-Magnon cave dwellers on Gibraltar and stretching to the present, Abulafia treats the Great Sea as &#x201c;the Liquid Continent,&#x201d; a place peopled and traveled&#x2014;where trade, cultural exchange, and empire-building were forces as key to life as currents, tides, and weather patterns. The book deftly illustrates how the Mediterranean was always big enough to keep cultures apart, thus allowing them the space to flourish as unique entities, but that it was never so big that differing cultures couldn&#x2019;t interact. The result is an epic story of trade and conflict, showing how differences in language, religion, law, and other human flashpoints sparked so much of what we think of today simply as <em>culture</em>. --<em>Chris Schluep</em> <p></p> <strong><br>Amazon Exclusive: Author Q&amp;A with David Abulafia</strong> <p> </p><table> <tbody> <tr> <td></td> </tr> <tr> <td>Author David Abulafia</td> </tr> <tr> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p></p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> What role did Greek mythology and Homeric poetry play in creating a lasting conception of the Mediterranean?</p> <p><strong>A:</strong> The seas described in Homer's <em>Odyssey</em> are a strange amalgam of the Mediterranean and the Black Sea, of east and west. Circe the sorceress seems to live in the east, where the sun rises, while Scylla and Charybdis are often identified with the straits between Sicily and mainland Italy.</p> <p>Despite those muddles, Homer does provide fascinating testimony to knowledge of the seas among the Greek colonists in Ionia (what is now eastern Turkey), whose dialect was the basis of Homeric Greek. He knew about Phoenician sailors and was not very complimentary about them. Above all, he placed Odysseus' kingdom at the western limits of Greece, on Ithaka, which he portrayed as an island where it was natural to know how to handle boats. What we see is a dawning conception of the extent of the Mediterranean and of the importance of the sea to the early Greeks.</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> Beyond the historical, military significance of the Mediterranean, what happened culturally that we tend to overlook?</p> <p><strong>A:</strong> The Mediterranean has been a meeting place of many different ethnic and religious groups, inhabiting its shores and islands--in remote antiquity, Greeks, Etruscans, Phoenicians; in later centuries, Jews, Christians and Muslims. Gathering in the port cities around the Mediterranean, such as ancient Marseilles, medieval Palermo and Alexandria, modern Livorno and Smyrna, these groups have interacted not just at the level of high culture but in everyday life. On the one hand you have the transmission of medical and astronomical knowledge from east to west in the Middle Ages, often via Muslim and Christian Spain, and on the other hand you have the peaceful interaction of traders and sailors doing business and respecting one another in the great ports of the Mediterranean. Often they were able to cross the boundaries between warring competitors for control of the sea, moving between Christian and Muslim lands under the protection of local rulers.</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> Americans and Europeans have vastly different conceptions of the Mediterranean Sea, with most Americans thinking of the Sea and its shores primarily for its appeal as a tourist destination. What role, if any, has the Mediterranean had in shaping the United States?</p> <p><strong>A:</strong> The American involvement in the Mediterranean at the start of the nineteenth century is a fascinating story--not just an episode but something that decisively altered the Mediterranean world. By defeating the rulers of the Barbary regencies (Algiers, Tunis, Tripoli), who detained their trading ships and sailors and demanded extortionate sums of money for their release, the American navy helped clear the Mediterranean of the five-century-long scourge of piracy. This was the first foreign war of the United States after independence, and it was now that the U.S. Navy came into existence. In the 20th century, the strategic significance of the Mediterranean in the Cold War brought the U.S.A.F. to Wheelus airfield in Libya and the conflict between Israel and its neighbors has also brought the U.S. Navy into the Mediterranean. Strategically, the Mediterranean has remained important to the U.S., as we see from the latest events in Libya.</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> Will the Mediterranean continue to play a key role in the global economy of the 21st century?</p> <p><strong>A:</strong> Much depends on the relationship between northern and southern Europe, and between Europe and North Africa. With the Greek economy in desperate straits and the Italian and Spanish economies under severe strain, and with the Arab countries in turmoil, there is a big question mark over the assumption that rapid economic growth will continue in the region. One solution may be to build closer bonds between northern and southern Mediterranean countries, including free trade concessions to Tunisia and Libya. Tunisia possessed the strongest economy in Africa and it would be a disaster to ignore its great economic potential. Another question arises over Chinese investment and involvement in the Mediterranean, which has begun to accumulate. So we are looking at a particularly uncertain future.</p><br><strong>David Abulafia</strong> is Professor of Mediterranean History at Cambridge University and the author of <em>The Mediterranean in History</em>.<br></p><h2>ACSM&#39;s Resources for the Personal Trainer (American College of Sports Medicine)</h2><p>Published by the American College of Sports Medicine, this Fifth Edition of <i>ACSM&#x2019;s Resources for the Personal</i> Trainer is the critical content for those seeking to gain ACSM&#x2019;s Certified Personal Trainer certification, and those currently practicing.

In 1949 David Park destroyed many of his nonobjective canvases and began a new style of consciously naive figuration. Soon Elmer Bischoff and Richard Diebenkorn joined Park and other painters such as Nathan Oliveira, Theophilus Brown, James Weeks, and Paul Wonner in the move away from abstraction and toward figurative subject matter. When artists such as Bruce McGaw, Manuel Neri, and Joan Brown emerged as a second generation of figurative artists, the momentum grew for a powerful new development in American painting.<br><br>The achievement of Bay Area Figurative painters and sculptors has become directly relevant to current debates regarding abstraction and representation, as well as to discourses on modernism and postmodernism. Indeed, the historical phenomenon of the movement is an important case study in the evolution of modernism in America, serving as an early example of rupture in the formalist "mainstream."<br><br><i>Bay Area Figurative Art 1950-1965</i> was written to accompany an exhibition of the same name at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art.

The story of Bigger Thomas, a young black man living in the raw, noisy, crowded slums of Chicago&#x2019;s South Side, captured the hopes and yearnings, the pain and rage of black Americans with an unprecedented intensity and vividness. The text printed in this volume restores the changes and cuts&#x2014;including the replacement of an entire scene&#x2014;that Wright was forced to make by book club editors who feared offending their readers. The unexpurgated version of Wright&#x2019;s electrifying novel shows his determination to write honestly about his controversial protagonist. As he wrote in the essay &#x201c;How &#x2018;Bigger&#x2019; Was Born,&#x201d; which accompanies the novel: &#x201c;I became convinced that if I did not write Bigger as I saw and felt him, I&#x2019;d be acting out of fear.&#x201d;<br><br>This volume also contains Wright&#x2019;s first novel,&nbsp;<i>Lawd Today!</i>, published posthumously in 1963, and his collection of stories,&nbsp;<i>Uncle Tom&#x2019;s Children</i>, which appeared in 1938.&nbsp;<i>Lawd Today!</i>&nbsp;interweaves news bulletins, songs, exuberant wordplay, and scenes of confrontation and celebration into a kaleidoscopic chronicle of the events of one day&#x2014;February 12&#x2014;in the life of a black Chicago postal worker. The text for this edition reinstates Wright&#x2019;s stylistic experiments, and the novel emerges as a far livelier work of the imagination.<br><br><i>Uncle Tom&#x2019;s Children</i>&nbsp;first brought Wright to national attention when it received the Story Prize for the best work submitted to the Federal Writers&#x2019; Project. The characters in these tales struggle to survive the cruelty of racism in the South, as Wright asks &#x201c;what quality of will must a Negro possess to live and die with dignity in a country that denied his humanity.&#x201d; All five stories Wright included in the 1940 second edition are published in this volume, along with his sardonic autobiographical essay &#x201c;The Ethics of Living Jim Crow.&#x201d;<br><br>Richard Wright was &#x201c;forged in injustice as a sword is forged,&#x201d; wrote Ernest Hemingway. With passionate honesty and courage, he confronted the terrible effects of prejudice and intolerance and created works that explore the deepest conflicts of the human heart.<br><br>This Library of America edition presents for the first time Wright&#x2019;s works in the form in which he intended them to be read. The authoritative new texts, based on Wright&#x2019;s original typescripts and proofs, reveal the full range and power of his achievement as an experimental stylist and as a fiery prophet of the tragic consequences of racism in American society.

His major works include the story collection&nbsp;<i>Uncle Tom's Children</i>, the novel&nbsp;<i>Native Son</i>, and the autobiography&nbsp;<i>Black Boy</i>.<p><b>The Ethics of Living Jim Crow</b></p><p><b>An Autobiographical Sketch</b></p><p>My first lesson in how to live as a Negro came when I was quite small. We were living in Arkansas. Our house stood behind the railroad tracks. Its skimpy yard was paved with black cinders. Nothing green ever grew in that yard. The only touch of green we could see was far away, beyond the tracks, over where the white folks lived. But cinders were good enough for me and I never missed the green growing things. And, anyhow, cinders were fine weapons. You could always have a nice hot war with huge black cinders. AH you had to do was crouch behind the brick pillars of a house with your hands full of gritty ammunition. And the first woolly black head you saw pop out from behind another row of pillars was your target. You tried your very best to knock it off. It was great fun.</p><p>I never fully realized the appalling disadvantages of a cinder environment till one day the gang to which I belonged found itself engaged in a war with the white boys who lived beyond the tracks. As usual we laid down our cinder barrage, thinking that this would wipe the white boys out. But they replied with a steady bombardment of broken bottles. We doubled our cinder barrage, but they hid behind trees, hedges, and the sloping embankments of their lawns. Having no such fortifications, we retreated to the brick pillars of our homes. During the retreat a broken milk bottle caught me behind the ear, opening a deep gash which bled profusely. The sight of blood pouring over my face completely demoralized our ranks. My fellow-combatants left me standing paralyzed in the center of the yard, and scurried for their homes. A kind neighbor saw me and rushed me to a doctor, who took three stitches in my neck. </p><p>I sat brooding on my front steps, nursing my wound and waiting for my mother to come from work. I felt that a grave injustice had been done me. It was all right to throw cinders. The greatest harm a cinder could do was leave a bruise. But broken bottles were dangerous; they left you cut, bleeding, and helpless. </p><p>When night fell, my mother came from the white folks' kitchen. I raced down the street to meet her. I could just feel in my bones that she would understand. I knew she would tell me exactly what to do next time. I grabbed her hand and babbled out the whole story. She examined my wound, then slapped me. </p><p>"How come yuh didn't hide?" she asked me. "How come yuh awways fightin?" </p><p>I was outraged, and bawled. Between sobs I told her that I didn't, have any trees or hedges to hide behind. There wasn't a thing I could have used as a trench. And you couldn't throw very far when you were hiding behind the brick pillars of a house. She grabbed a barrel stave, dragged me home, stripped me naked, and beat me till I had a fever of one hundred and two. She would smack my rump with the stave, and, while the skin was still smarting, impart to me gems of Jim Crow wisdom. I was never to throw cinders any more. I was never to fight any more wars. I was -never, never, under any conditions, to fight white folks again. And they were absolutely right in clouting me with the broken milk bottle. Didn't I know she was working hard every day in the hot kitchens of the <i>white</i> folks to make money to take care of me? When was I ever going to learn to be a good boy? She couldn't be bothered with my fights. She finished by telling me that I ought to be thankful to God as long as I lived that they didn't kill me. </p><p>All that night I was delirious and could not sleep. Each time I dosed my eyes I saw monstrous white faces suspended from the ceiling, leering at me. </p><p>From that time on, the charm of my cinder yard was gone. The green trees, the trimmed hedges, the cropped lawns grew very meaningful became a symbol. Even today when I dunk of white folks, the hard, sharp outlines of white houses surrounded by trees, lawns, and hedges are present somewhere in the background of my mind. Through the years they grew into an overreaching symbol of fear. </p><p>It was a long time before I came in close contact with white folks again. We moved from Arkansas to Mississippi. Here we had the good fortune not to live behind the railroad tracks, or close to white neighborhoods. We lived in the very heart of the local Black Belt. There were black churches and, black preachers; there were black schools and black teachers; black groceries and black clerks. In fact, everything was so solidly black that for a long time I did not even think of white folks, save in remote and vague terms. But this could not last forever. As one grows older one eats more. One's clothing costs more. When I finished grammar school I had to go to work. My mother could no longer feed and clothe me on her cooking job. </p><p>There is but one place where a black boy who knows no trade can get a job, and that's where the houses and faces are white, where the trees, lawns, and hedges are green. My first job was with an optical company in Jackson, Mississippi. The morning I applied I stood straight and neat before die boss, answering all his questions with sharp yessirs and nosirs. I was very careful to pronounce my <i>sirs</i> distinctly, in order that he might know that I was polite, that I knew where I was, and that I knew he was a <i>white</i> nun. I wanted that job badly.</p></p><h2>Elements of Design: Rowena Reed Kostellow and the Structure of Visual Relationships</h2><p>A hands-on book design students and designers alike will welcome.Elements of Design is a tribute to an exceptional teacher and a study of the abstract visual relationships that were her lifelong pursuit.

But America's imperial identity was actually shaped much closer to home. In a brilliant excavation of long-obscured history, <i>Empire's Workshop</i> shows how Latin America has functioned as a proving ground for American strategies and tactics overseas. Historian Greg Grandin follows the United States' imperial operations from Jefferson's aspirations for an "empire of liberty" in Cuba and Spanish Florida to Reagan's support for brutally oppressive but U.S.-friendly regimes in Central America. He traces the origins of Bush's current policies back to Latin America, where many of the administration's leading lights first embraced the deployment of military power to advance free market economics and enlisted the evangelical movement in support of their ventures.</p><p>With much of Latin America now in open rebellion against U.S. domination, Grandin asks: If Washington failed to bring prosperity and democracy to Latin America&#x2015;its own backyard "workshop"&#x2015;what are the chances it will do so for the world?</p></p><p><b>Greg Grandin</b> is the author of <i>Fordlandia</i>, <i>Empire's Workshop</i>, <i>The Last Colonial Massacre</i>, and the award-winning <i>The Blood of Guatemala</i>. An associate professor of Latin American history at New York University, and a Guggenheim fellow, Grandin has served on the United Nations Truth Commission investigating the Guatemalan Civil War and has written for the <i>Los Angeles Times</i>, <i>The Nation</i>, <i>The New Statesman</i>, and <i>The New York Times</i>.<p><strong>Introduction</strong><br>The Camel Not in the Koran<br><br>The Argentine writer Jorge Luis Borges once remarked that the lack of camels in the Koran proves its Middle Eastern provenance: only a native author, he explained, could have so taken the animal for granted as not to mention it. Perhaps a similar familiarity explains the absence of Latin America in recent discussions about the United States and its empire. Though Latin America has played an indispensable role in the rise of the United States to global power, it elicits little curiosity from its neighbor to the north. &#x201c;Latin America doesn&#x2019;t matter,&#x201c; Richard Nixon advised a young Donald Rumsfeld, who was casting about for career opportunities. &#x201c;Long as we&#x2019;ve been in it, people don&#x2019;t give one damn about Latin America.&#x201d;1 Likewise today. In their search for historical precedents for our current imperial moment, intellectuals invoke postwar reconstructions of Germany and Japan, ancient Rome and nineteenth-century Britain but consistently ignore the one place where the United States has projected its influence for more than two centuries. &#x201c;People don&#x2019;t give one shit&#x201d; about the place, Nixon said.2<br><br>Were it not for Borges&#x2019;s insight, this studied indifference to Latin America would seem ironic, for the region has long served as a workshop of empire, the place where the United States elaborated tactics of extraterritorial administration and acquired its conception of itself as an empire like no other before it. The Western Hemisphere was to be the staging ground for a new &#x201c;empire for liberty,&#x201c; a phrase used by Thomas Jefferson specifically in reference to Spanish Florida and Cuba. Unlike European empires, ours was supposed to entail a concert of equal, sovereign democratic American republics, with shared interests and values, led but not dominated by the United States--a conception of empire that remains Washington&#x2019;s guiding vision.<br><br>The same direction of influence is evident in any number of examples. The United States&#x2019;s engagement with the developing world after World War II, for instance, is often viewed as an extension of its postwar policies in Europe and Japan, yet that view has it exactly backwards. Washington&#x2019;s first attempts, in fact, to restructure another country&#x2019;s economy took place in the developing world--in Mexico in the years after the American Civil War and in Cuba following the Spanish-American War. &#x201c;We should do for Europe on a large scale,&#x201c; remarked the U.S. ambassador to England in 1914, &#x201c;essentially what we did for Cuba on a small scale and thereby usher in a new era of human history.&#x201d; Likewise, most discussions of George W. Bush&#x2019;s foreign policy focus on the supposed innovation of a small group of neoconservative intellectuals in asserting the right to unilateral preemptive military action both to defend national security and to advance American ideals. But neither the neocons&#x2019; dire view of a crisis-ridden world that justifies the use of unilateral and brutal American military power nor their utopian vision of the same world made whole and happy by that power is new. Both have been fully in operation in Washington&#x2019;s approach to Latin America for over a century. The history of the United States in Latin America is cluttered with &#x201c;preemptive&#x201d; interventions that even the most stalwart champions of U.S. hegemony have trouble defending.<br><br>From the mid-nineteenth to the early twentieth century, the U.S. military sharpened its fighting skills and developed its modern-day organizational structure largely in constant conflict with Latin America--in its drive west when it occupied Mexico in the mid-nineteenth century and took more than half of that country&#x2019;s national territory. And in its push south: by 1930, Washington had sent gunboats into Latin American ports over six thousand times, invaded Cuba, Mexico (again), Guatemala, and Honduras, fought protracted guerrilla wars in the Dominican Republic, Nicaragua, and Haiti, annexed Puerto Rico, and taken a piece of Colombia to create both the Panamanian nation and the Panama Canal. For their part, American corporations and financial houses came to dominate the economies of Mexico, the Caribbean, and Central America, as well as large parts of South America, apprenticing themselves in overseas expansion before they headed elsewhere, to Asia, Africa, and Europe.<br><br>Yet Latin America did more than serve as a staging ground for the United States&#x2019;s early push toward empire. The region provided a school where foreign policy officials and intellectuals could learn to apply what political scientists like to call &#x201c;soft power&#x201d;--that is, the spread of America&#x2019;s authority through nonmilitary means, through commerce, cultural exchange, and multilateral cooperation.3<br><br>At first, the United States proved a reluctant student. It took decades of mounting Latin American anti-imperialist resistance, including armed resistance, to force Washington to abandon its militarism. But abandon it it finally did, at least for a short time. In the early 1930s, Franklin D. Roosevelt promised that henceforth the United States would be a &#x201c;good neighbor,&#x201c; that it would recognize the absolute sovereignty of individual nations, renounce its right to engage in unilateral interventions, and make concessions to economic nationalists. Rather than weaken U.S. influence in the Western Hemisphere, this newfound moderation in fact institutionalized Washington&#x2019;s authority, drawing Latin American republics tighter into its political, economic, and cultural orbit through a series of multilateral treaties and regional organizations. The Good Neighbor policy was the model for the European and Asian alliance system, providing a blueprint for America&#x2019;s &#x201c;empire by invitation,&#x201c; as one historian famously described Washington&#x2019;s rise to unprecedented heights of world power.4<br><br>But even as Washington was working out the contours of its kinder, gentler empire in postwar Western Europe and Japan, back in the birthplace of American soft power it was rearming. Latin America once again became a school where the United States studied how to execute imperial violence through proxies. After World War II, in the name of containing Communism, the United States, mostly through the actions of local allies, executed or encouraged coups in, among other places, Guatemala, Brazil, Chile, Uruguay, and Argentina and patronized a brutal mercenary war in Nicaragua. Latin America became a laboratory for counterinsurgency, as military officials and covert operators applied insights learned in the region to Southeast Asia, Africa, and the Middle East. By the end of the Cold War, Latin American security forces trained, funded, equipped, and incited by Washington had executed a reign of bloody terror--hundreds of thousands killed, an equal number tortured, millions driven into exile--from which the region has yet to fully recover.<br><br>This reign of terror has had consequences more far-reaching than the damage done to Latin America itself, for it was this rehabilitation of hard power that directly influenced America&#x2019;s latest episode of imperial overreach in the wake of 9/11.<br><br>It is often noted in passing that a number of the current administration&#x2019;s officials, advisers, and hangers-on are veterans of Ronald Reagan&#x2019;s Central American policy in the 1980s, which included the patronage of anti-Communist governments in El Salvador and Guatemala and anti-Communist insurgents in Nicaragua. The list includes Elliott Abrams, Bush&#x2019;s current deputy national security adviser in charge of promoting democracy throughout the world; John Negroponte, former U.N. ambassador, envoy to Iraq, and now intelligence czar; Otto Reich, secretary of state for the Western Hemisphere during Bush&#x2019;s first term; and Robert Kagan, an ardent advocate of U.S. global hegemony. John Poindexter, convicted of lying to Congress, conspiracy, and destroying evidence in the Iran-Contra scandal during his tenure as Reagan&#x2019;s national security adviser, was appointed by Rumsfeld to oversee the Pentagon&#x2019;s stillborn Total Information Awareness program. John Bolton, ambassador to the United Nations and an arch-unilateralist, served as Reagan&#x2019;s point man in the Justice Department to stonewall investigations into Iran-Contra.5<br><br>Yet the links between the current Bush administration&#x2019;s revolution in foreign policy and Reagan&#x2019;s hard line in Central America are even more profound than the simple recycling of personnel. It was Central America, and Latin America more broadly, where an insurgent New Right first coalesced, as conservative activists used the region to respond to the crisis of the 1970s, a crisis provoked not only by America&#x2019;s defeat in Vietnam but by a deep economic recession and a culture of skeptical antimilitarism and political dissent that spread in the war&#x2019;s wake. Indeed, Reagan&#x2019;s Central American wars can best be understood as a dress rehearsal for what is going on now in the Middle East. It was in these wars where the coalition made up of neoconservatives, Christian evangelicals, free marketers, and nationalists that today stands behind George W. Bush&#x2019;s expansive foreign policy first came together. There they had near free rein to bring the full power of the United States against a much weaker enemy in order to exorcise the ghost of Vietnam--and, in so doing, begin the transformation of America&#x2019;s foreign policy and domestic culture.<br><br>A critical element of that transformation entailed shifting the rationale of American diplomacy away from containment to rollback, from one primarily justified in terms of national defense to one charged with advancing what Bush likes to call a &#x201c;global democratic revolution.&#x201d; The domestic fight over how to respond to revolutionary nationalism in Central America allowed conservative ideologues to ...</p></p><h2>Unfaithful Music &amp; Disappearing Ink</h2><p><p><b>The perfect gift for music lovers and Elvis Costello fans, telling the story behind Elvis Costello&#x2019;s legendary career and his iconic, beloved songs.&nbsp;</b><br> <i><br> Unfaithful Music &amp; Disappearing Ink</i>&nbsp;provides readers with a master&#x2019;s catalogue of a lifetime of great music.

Fortunately for the fan of Costello&#x2019;s music the topic of discussion is often his own songs, and he is, unsurprisingly, a witty and eloquent guide.&#x201d;&nbsp;<b><i>&#x2014;</i>Paul Grimstad<i>, New Republic</i></b><br><br> &#x201c;Long one of music's wittiest, smartest, and most perceptive lyricists, Costello has done his legacy proud with his new book, which, thankfully, goes far beyond his angry-young-man days, most movingly in its frequent reminiscences about the relationship between the singer and his musician father.&#x201d;&nbsp;<b><i>&#x2014;New York Magazine</i></b><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;[Costello] pens books with the same clever writing that he uses in song.&#x201d;&nbsp;<b>&#x2014;Kathy Flanigan<i>, Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel<br> </i></b><br> &#x201c;Costello[&#x2018;s] book is capacious, clever, and full of heart and soul.&#x201d;&nbsp;<b><i>&#x2014;</i>Dan DeLuca<i>, Philadelphia Inquirer<br></i></b><br> &#x201c;The story unfolds like a movie that jumps across time, more thematic than chronological, as boyhood anecdotes and obsessions intersect with mature songs and adult reckoning.... The book doubles as a selective mini-history of 20th century music, as told by a discerning guide. He addresses artists both towering (Bob Dylan, Joni Mitchell, Johnny Cash) and relatively unheralded (David Ackles, Robert Wyatt) with a fan's affection and music scholar's insight.&#x201d; <b>&#x2013;Greg Kot, <i>Chicago Tribune</i></b><br><br>"With an encyclopedic knowledge and appreciation for, and deep love of, music, and with an expressive power and heart, Costello&#x2019;s memoir will take its place in the highest echelons of the genre." <i><b>--Library Journal (starred review)</b></i><br><br>&#x201c;This is a big book, literally, by one of the best rockers in the business.

Syed has maintained his innocence, and Rabia Chaudry, a family friend, has always believed him. By 2013, after almost all appeals had been exhausted, Rabia contacted Sarah Koenig, a producer at <i>This American Life</i>, in hopes of finding a journalist who could shed light on Adnan&#x2019;s story. In 2014, Koenig's investigation turned into <i>Serial</i>, a Peabody Award-winning podcast with more than 500 million international listeners</p><p>But<i> Serial</i> did not tell the whole story. In this compelling narrative, Rabia Chaudry presents new key evidence that she maintains dismantles the State's case: a potential new suspect, forensics indicating Hae was killed and kept somewhere for almost half a day, and documentation withheld by the State that destroys the cell phone evidence -- among many other points -- and she shows how fans of <i>Serial</i> joined a crowd-sourced investigation into a case riddled with errors and strange twists. <i>Adnan's Story</i> also shares Adnan&#x2019;s life in prison, and weaves in his personal reflections, including never-before-seen letters. Chaudry, who is committed to exonerating Adnan, makes it clear that justice is yet to be achieved in this much examined case.</p></p><p>RABIA CHAUDRY is an attorney and partner at Chaudry &amp; Anwer Immigration Law, a recent Jennings Randolph Fellow at the U.S. Institute of Peace, an International Security Fellow at the New America think tank, and a Fellow of the Shalom Hartman Institute.

Frey, author of the internationally best-selling books on the craft of writing, <i>How to Write a Damn Good Novel</i>, <i>How to Write a Damn Good Novel II: Advanced Techniques</i>, and <i>The Key: How to Write Damn Good Fiction Using the Power of Myth</i>, has now written what is certain to become the standard "how to" book for mystery writing, <i>How to Write a Damn Good Mystery</i>.</p><p>Frey urges writers to aim high-not to try to write a good-enough-to-get-published mystery, but a damn good mystery. A damn good mystery is first a dramatic novel, Frey insists-a dramatic novel with living, breathing characters-and he shows his readers how to create a living, breathing, believable character who will be clever and resourceful, willful and resolute, and will be what Frey calls "the author of the plot behind the plot."</p><p>Frey then shows, in his well-known, entertaining, and accessible (and often humorous) style , how the characters-the entire ensemble, including the murderer, the detective, the authorities, the victims, the suspects, the witnesses and the bystanders-create a complete and coherent world.</p><p>Exploring both the on-stage action and the behind-the-scenes intrigue, Frey shows prospective writers how to build a fleshed-out, believable, and logical world. He shows them exactly which parts of that world show up in the pages of a damn good mystery-and which parts are held back just long enough to keep the reader guessing.</p><p>This is an indispensable step-by-step guide for anyone who's ever dreamed of writing a damn good mystery.</p></p><p><p><b>James N. Frey</b> is the author of internationally bestselling books on the craft of fiction writing, including <i>How to Write a Damn Good Novel</i>, <i>How to Write a Damn Good Novel II: Advanced Techniques</i>, and <i>The Key: How to Write Damn Good Fiction Using the Power of Myth</i>. He is also the author of nine novels, including the Edgar Award-nominated <i>The Long Way to Die</i>. He has taught at the University of California, Berkeley, Extension, the Squaw Valley Community of Writers, and the Oregon Writers' Colony, and he is a featured speaker at writers' conferences throughout the United States and Europe. Former students include recent Anthony award-nominees Betty Winkleman and Cara Black, and many best-selling authors including Marjorie Reynolds, Melba Beals, and April Sinclair.</p>From the author of <i>How to Write a Damn Good Novel</i> (1987) comes a companion volume aimed at would-be mystery writers. Frey doesn't believe in those collections "of tips on what to do and what not to do," arguing that they give the false impression that writing good fiction is merely a matter of mixing ingredients in the right proportions. Instead, Frey contains, the key to a good mystery isn't picking clues and getting the technical stuff right; it's a matter of finding the right people to tell your story, finding the right words to frame it, finding the right sequence of events to maximize suspense. Frey also spends time on an important but frequently neglected aspect of the writerly trade: the audience. Who reads mysteries, and what do they expect from them? Meanwhile, he tackles the nuts and bolts in a particularly clever manner, by guiding the reader through the creation of a virtual novel, which he calls <i>Murder in Montana</i>. This approach proves eminently practical and rich in details. A must for budding crime-fiction authors. <i>David Pitt</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Her father had a small farm and the children took part in the farm work. In the early 1940s Maria Thun met her future husband Walter Thun, who introduced her to some biodynamic farmers and Maria became greatly interested in these farming methods. She continued to experiment with sowing during the 1950s with many types of crops to see whether the movement of the moon had the same effect on all crops. From her observations she divided passage of the moon through the zodiac into four: root days, leaf days, fruit days and flower days, each indicating which type of plant is best sown on each specific day.

In the manner of David Mitchell&#x2019;s Black Swan Green, Mikael Niemi tells a story of a rural Sweden at once foreign and familiar, as a magical childhood slowly fades with the seasons into adult reality.</p><p>MIKAEL NIEMI was born in 1959 and grew up in Pajala in the northernmost part of Sweden, near the Finnish border, where he still lives. He is the author of several books of poetry and fiction for both young people and adults.&#x201c;Niemi&#x2019;s entrancing debut novel is a coming-of-age story set in Pajala, Sweden, a remote district above the Arctic Circle. It is the early 1960&#x2019;s, and Matti and his peculiar sidekick, Niila, are fascinated by their exotic corner of the world as by their newest discoveries: girls and rock music.&#x201d; --<i>New York Times Book Review<br><br></i>&#x201c;Niemi&#x2019;s finest achievement is to have created a world poised between an adult&#x2019;s fantastic memories of childhood and a child&#x2019;s naive dreams of his future.&#x201d;--Los Angeles Times Book Review<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s safe to say that contemporary Finnish fiction is pretty much unknown in North America, but Mikael Niemi&#x2019;s tale, a runaway bestseller in Scandinavia, should go some way toward changing that...This &#x201c;playful, rueful, and wondrous&#x201d; novel with a magic realist touch is also funny and moving.&#x201d; --<i>The Globe and Mail</i>: The Globe 100 (Canada)<br><br>&#x201c;Matti and Niila, transfixed by a Beatles record, decide they must form their own rock band, and their devotion to music and to each other is the theme that dominates the rest of the novel. The boys become men, life expands, and the bittersweet feeling of nostalgia remains once the last page has turned ... Through Laurie Thompson&#x2019;s excellent, lively translation, the English-speaking population can now experience this small corner of the planet called Pajala -- and be glad they&#x2019;ve taken the trip.&#x201d;&nbsp;--<i>World Literature Today</i><br><br>"Matti&#x2019;s narrative voice is as distinctive and charming as that of Huckleberry Finn. But, as with Mark Twain, the comedy is shadowed with melancholy -- even terror that will unsettle the reader sometimes. The book is filled with eccentric. Grotesque, even unsavory characters, but Niemi shows large tolerance, kindly spirit and even clear pleasure in these odd neighbors. They are human, too.&#x201d;&nbsp;&nbsp;--<i>Minneapolis Star-Tribune<br><br>&#x201c;Popular Music From Vittula</i> is bound to become a classic of cold-weather literature. Jack London with the imagination of a Borges might have produced a work so wise and witty in weather so unpleasant, but, probably only Mikael Niemi, with his intrepid translator, Laurie Thompson, could have made so much art out of so much ice.

Compassionate and humorous, the grace and style of Shepherd's prose is heightened by a superb ear for the vigorous language of the north-east.<br><i>The Weatherhouse</i>, Shepherd's masterpiece, is an even more substantial achievement which belongs to the great line of Scottish fiction dealing with the complex interactions of small communities, and especially the community of women - a touching and hilarious network of mothers, daughters, spinsters and widows. It is also a striking meditation on the nature of truth, the power of human longing and the mystery of being.<br>The third and final novel, <i>A Pass in the Grampians</i>, describes Jenny Kilgour's coming of age as she has to choose between the kindly harshness of her grandfather's life on a remote hill farm, and the vulgar and glorious energy of Bella Cassie, a local girl who left the community to pursue success as a singer, and has now returned to scandalise them all.<br><i>The Living Mountain</i> is a lyrical testament in praise of the Cairngorms. It is a work deeply rooted in Shepherd's knowledge of the natural world, and a poetic and philosophical meditation on our longing for high and holy places.</p><p>This omnibus edition of Shepherd's prose works reveals how her sensitivity and powers of observation raise her work far above the status of regional literature and into the front rank of Scottish writing.</p></p><p>Edited and introductions by Roderick WatsonAnna (Nan) Shepherd was born in 1893 and died in 1981.

For a while afterwards, everything you look at will have the book&#x2019;s imprint on it; your world will be colored in the book&#x2019;s tones, and you will glimpse the book&#x2019;s characters on the street and feel your heart knocking in your chest for a few blocks, as if you&#x2019;d escaped a close call.</p> <p>This is how I felt after I read Rachel Kushner&#x2019;s brilliant <i>The Flamethrowers</i>. The night I finished it, I dreamt of racing motorcycles across sun-shot salt-flats and of floating in glimmering Italian swimming pools. In the morning, I tried to describe the book to a friend but I eventually faltered into silence.</p> <p>This is a <i>beautiful</i> book, I finally said, a book full of truth, a book about art and motorcycle racing and radicalism, about innocence and speed and stepping up to a dangerous brink, a book very deeply about the late seventies in New York City and its powerful blend of grittiness and philosophical purity.</p> <p>Oh, said my friend. So. What is it about?</p> <p>I tried again. I said: It&#x2019;s a love story, about a young artist under the sway of an older, established artist, scion of a motorcycle family, who betrays her, and she joins up with an underground group in Italy. It feels like a contemporary European novel, philosophical and intelligent, with an American heart and narrative drive, I said.</p> <p>Oh, said my friend.</p> <p>Just read the book, I said and my friend did, and loved it to speechlessness, as well. Wow, is all he could say when he returned the book to me.</p> <p>I don&#x2019;t blame him. The truth is, this is a strange and mysterious novel, a subtle novel. Much of its power comes from the precision of Kushner&#x2019;s language and how carefully she allows the flashes of perception to drive the narrative forward. See Reno, the offbeat narrator, describing ski racing to her lover, Sandro, saying, &#x201c;Ski racing was drawing <i>in time</i>.&#x201d; Suddenly you can see what she means, a body&#x2019;s crisp slaloming down the white slope, the way the skier draws a perfect serpent down the clock.</p> <p>Or see Reno, racing her motorcycle: &#x201c;Far ahead of me, the salt flats and mountains conspired into one puddled vortex. I began to feel the size of this place. Or perhaps I did not feel it, but the cycle, whose tires marked its size with each turn, did. I felt a tenderness for them, speeding along under me.&#x201d; There is something deeply eerie happening under the words, something on the verge of tipping over and spilling out; and, at the same time, a gentleness and innocence at the core of all that noise and speed.</p> <p>Rachel Kushner is an unbelievably exciting writer, a writer of urgent and beautiful sentences and novels that are vast in their ambition and achievement. I finished it months ago, but <i>The Flamethrowers</i>&#x2014;startling, radiant&#x2014;still haunts me.</p>Rachel Kushner is the bestselling author of&nbsp;<i>The Flamethrowers</i>, a finalist for the National Book Award and a&nbsp;<i>New York Times</i>&nbsp;Top Ten Book of 2013; <i>Telex from Cuba</i>,&nbsp;a finalist for the National Book Award; and&nbsp;<i>The Mars Room</i>.

By the following April, the book was finished. Titled <i>The Seven Lamps of Architecture,</i> it was far more than a treatise on the Gothic style; instead, it elaborated Ruskin's deepest convictions of the nature and role of architecture and its aesthetics. The book was published to immediate acclaim and has since become an acknowledged classic.<br>The "seven lamps" are Sacrifice, Truth, Power, Beauty, Life, Memory, and Obedience. In delineating the relationship of these terms to architecture, Ruskin distinguishes between architecture and mere building. Architecture is an exalting discipline that must dignify and ennoble public life. It must preserve the purity of the materials it uses; and it must serve as a source of power and renewal for the society that produces it. The author expounds these and many other ideas with exceptional passion and knowledge, expressed in a masterly prose style.<br>Today, Ruskin's timeless observations are as relevant as they were in Victorian times, making <i>The Seven Lamps of Architecture</i> required reading for architects, students, and other lovers of architecture, who will find in these pages a thoughtful and inspiring approach to one of man's noblest endeavors.<br>This authoritative edition includes excellent reproductions of the 14 original plates of Ruskin's superb drawings of architectural details from such structures as the Doge's Palace in Venice, Giotto's Campanile in Florence, and the Cathedral of Rouen.</p><p>Kessinger Publishing reprints over 1,500 similar titles all available through Amazon.com.Book-length essay on architecture by John Ruskin, published in 1849. According to Ruskin, the leading principles of architecture are the "lamps" of Sacrifice, Truth, Power, Beauty, Life, Memory, and Obedience. The noblest style of architecture was Gothic, but in time medieval architecture had lost the power to resist innovation. This loss of vitality was the result of the spiritual decline of Christianity during the materialistic Renaissance. The essay took the studies of a generation of medievalists and provided them with a general framework and a moral flavor. -- <i>The Merriam-Webster Encyclopedia of Literature</i></p><h2>Pursuits of Happiness: The Hollywood Comedy of Remarriage (Harvard Film Studies)</h2><p><p>During the &#x2019;30s and &#x2019;40s, Hollywood produced a genre of madcap comedies that emphasized reuniting the central couple after divorce or separation.

The day is typically unstable, the garden lush and shining, the branches weighty with still-falling rain.&nbsp;<br><br> There is a man and the man is me.<br><br> I am at the back door, tobacco tin in hand, and I am watching something in the trees, a figure, standing at the perimeter of the garden, where the aspens crowd in at the fence. Another man.<br> He&#x2019;s carrying a pair of binoculars and a camera.<br><br> A -bird--watcher, I am telling myself as I pull the frail paper along my tongue, you get them in these parts. But at the same time I&#x2019;m thinking, -Really? -Bird--watching, this far up the valley? I&#x2019;m also thinking, Where is my daughter, the baby, my wife? How quickly could I reach them, if I needed to?<br><br> My heart cranks into high gear, -thud--thudding against my ribs. I squint into the white sky. I am about to step out into the garden. I want the guy to know I&#x2019;ve seen him, to see me seeing him. I want him to register my size, my former -track--and--field--star physique (slackening and loosening a little, these days, admittedly). I want him to run the odds, me versus him, through his head. He&#x2019;s not to know I&#x2019;ve never been in a fight in my life and intend it to stay that way. I want him to feel what I used to feel before my father disciplined me: I am on to you, he would say, with a pointing finger, directed first at his chest, then mine.<br><br> I am on to you, I want to yell while I fumble to pocket my cigarette and lighter.<br><br> The guy is looking in the direction of the house. I see the tinder spark of sun on a lens and a movement of his arm that could be the brushing away of a hair across the forehead or the depression of a camera shutter.<br><br> Two things happen very fast. The dog&#x2014;a whiskery, leggy, slightly arthritic wolfhound, usually given to sleeping by the stove&#x2014; streaks out of the door, past my legs, and into the garden, emitting a volley of low barks, and a woman comes around the side of the house.<br><br> She has the baby on her back, she is wearing the kind of sou&#x2019;wester hood usually sported by North Sea fishermen, and she is holding a shotgun.<br><br> She is also my wife.<br><br> The latter fact I still have trouble adjusting to, not only because the idea of this creature ever agreeing to marry me is highly improbable, but also because she pulls unexpected shit like this all the time.<br><br> &#x201c;Jesus, honey,&#x201d; I gasp, and I am momentarily distracted by how shrill my voice is. &#x201c;Unmanly&#x201d; -doesn&#x2019;t cover it. I sound as if I&#x2019;m admonishing her for an -ill--judged choice in soft furnishings or for wearing pumps that clash with her purse.<br><br> She ignores my high-pitched intervention&#x2014;who can blame her?&#x2014;and fires into the air. Once, twice.<br> If, like me, you&#x2019;ve never heard a gun report at close range, let me tell you the noise is an ear shattering explosion. Magnesium-hued lights go off inside your head; your ears ring with the three-bar high note of an aria; your sinuses fill with tar.<br><br> The sound ricochets off the side of the house, off the flank of the mountain, then back again: a huge aural tennis ball bouncing about the valley. I realize that while I&#x2019;m ducking, cringing, covering my head,&nbsp;the baby is strangely unmoved. He&#x2019;s still sucking his thumb, head leaning against the spread of his mother&#x2019;s hair. Almost as if he&#x2019;s used to this. Almost as if he&#x2019;s heard it all before.<br> I straighten up. I take my hands off my ears. Far away, a figure is sprinting through the undergrowth. My wife turns around. She cracks the gun in the crook of her arm. She whistles for the dog. &#x201c;Ha,&#x201d; she says to me before she vanishes back around the side of the house. &#x201c;That&#x2019;ll show him.&#x201d;<br><br> My wife, I should tell you, is crazy. Not in a requiring-medication-and-wards-and-men-in-white-coats sense although I sometimes wonder if there may have been times in her past&#x2014;but in a subtle, more socially acceptable, less ostentatious way. She -doesn&#x2019;t think like other people. She believes that to pull a gun on someone lurking, in all likelihood entirely innocently, at our perimeter fence is not only permissible but indeed the right thing to do.<br><br>Here are the bare facts about the woman I married:<br> &#x2014;She&#x2019;s crazy, as I might have mentioned.<br> &#x2014;She&#x2019;s a recluse.<br><br> She&#x2019;s apparently willing to pull a gun on anyone threatening to uncover her hiding place.<br> I dart, insomuch as a man of my size can dart, through the house to catch her. I&#x2019;m going to have this out with her. She can&#x2019;t keep a gun in a house where there are small children. She just can&#x2019;t.<br><br> I&#x2019;m repeating this to myself as I pass through the house, planning to begin my protestations with it. But as I come through the front door, it&#x2019;s as if I&#x2019;m entering another world. Instead of the gray drizzle at the back, a dazzling, primrose-tinted sun fills the front garden, which gleams and sparks as if hewn from jewels. My daughter is leaping over a rope that her mother is -turning. My wife who, just a moment ago, was a dark, forbidding figure with a gun, a long gray coat, and a hat like Death&#x2019;s hood, she has shucked off the sou&#x2019;wester and transmogrified back to her usual incarnation. The baby is crawling on the grass, knees wet with rain, the bloom of an iris clutched in his fist, chattering to himself in a satisfied, guttural growl.<br><br>It&#x2019;s as if I&#x2019;ve stepped into another time frame entirely, as if I&#x2019;m in one of those folktales where you think you&#x2019;ve been asleep for an hour or so, but you wake to find you&#x2019;ve been away a lifetime, that all your loved ones and everything you&#x2019;ve ever known are dead and gone. Did I -really just walk in from the other side of the house, or did I fall asleep for a hundred years?<br><br> I shake off this notion. The gun business needs to be dealt with right now. &#x201c;Since when,&#x201d; I demand, &#x201c;do we own a firearm?&#x201d;<br><br> My wife raises her head and meets my eye with a challenging, flinty look, the skipping rope coming to a stop in her hand. &#x201c;We don&#x2019;t,&#x201d; she says. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s mine.&#x201d;<br><br> A typical parry from her. She appears to answer the question without answering it at all. She picks on the element that isn&#x2019;t the subject of the question. The essence of sidestepping.<br><br> I rally. I&#x2019;ve had more than enough practice. &#x201c;Since when do you own a firearm?&#x201d;<br><br> She shrugs a shoulder, bare, I notice, and tanned to a soft gold, bisected by a thin white strap. I feel a momentary automatic mobilization deep inside my underwear&#x2014;strange how this doesn&#x2019;t change with age for men, that we&#x2019;re all of us but a membrane away from our inner teenage selves&#x2014;but I pull my attention back to the discussion. She&#x2019;s not going to get away with this.<br><br> &#x201c;Since now,&#x201d; she says.<br><br> &#x201c;What&#x2019;s a fire arm?&#x201d; my daughter asks, splitting the word in two, her small, heart-shaped face tilted up to look at her mother.<br><br> &#x201c;It&#x2019;s an Americanism,&#x201d; my wife says. &#x201c;It means &#x2018;gun.&#x2019; &#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Oh, the gun,&#x201d; says my sweet Marithe, six years old, equal parts pixie, angel, and sylph. She turns to me. &#x201c;Father Christmas brought Donal a new one, so he said Maman could have his old one.&#x201d;<br><br> This utterance renders me, for a moment, speechless. Donal is an -ill--scented homunculus who farms the land farther down the valley. He&#x2014;and his wife, I&#x2019;d imagine&#x2014;have what you might call a problem with anger management. Somewhat trigger-happy, Donal. He shoots everything on sight: squirrels, rabbits, foxes, -hill walkers (just kidding).<br><br>&#x201c;What is going on?&#x201d; I say. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re keeping a firearm in the house and&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c; &#x2018;Gun,&#x2019; Daddy.

While some marvel at these changes, envisioning consciousness downloaded into a computer or humans "beamed" <i>Star Trek</i>-style, others view them with horror, seeing monsters brooding in the machines. In <i>How We Became Posthuman,</i> N. Katherine Hayles separates hype from fact, investigating the fate of embodiment in an information age.<br> <br> Hayles relates three interwoven stories: how information lost its body, that is, how it came to be conceptualized as an entity separate from the material forms that carry it; the cultural and technological construction of the cyborg; and the dismantling of the liberal humanist "subject" in cybernetic discourse, along with the emergence of the "posthuman."<br> <br> Ranging widely across the history of technology, cultural studies, and literary criticism, Hayles shows what had to be erased, forgotten, and elided to conceive of information as a disembodied entity. Thus she moves from the post-World War II Macy Conferences on cybernetics to the 1952 novel <i>Limbo</i> by cybernetics aficionado Bernard Wolfe; from the concept of self-making to Philip K. Dick's literary explorations of hallucination and reality; and from artificial life to postmodern novels exploring the implications of seeing humans as cybernetic systems.<br> <br> Although becoming posthuman can be nightmarish, Hayles shows how it can also be liberating. From the birth of cybernetics to artificial life, <i>How We Became Posthuman</i> provides an indispensable account of how we arrived in our virtual age, and of where we might go from here.<br></p></p><p>The title of this scholarly yet remarkably accessible slice of contemporary cultural history has a whiff of paradox about it: what can it mean, exactly, to say that we humans have become something other than human? The answer, Katherine Hayles explains, lies not in ourselves but in our tools. Ever since the invention of electronic computers five decades ago, these powerful new machines have inspired a shift in how we define ourselves both as individuals and as a species.<p> Hayles tracks this shift across the history of avant-garde computer theory, starting with Norbert Weiner and other early "cyberneticists," who were the first to systematically explore the similarities between living and computing systems. Hayles's study ends with artificial-life specialists, many of whom no longer even bother to distinguish between life forms and computers. Along the way she shows these thinkers struggling to reconcile their traditional, Western notions of human identity with the unsettling, cyborg directions in which their own work seems to be leading humanity.</p><p> This is more than just the story of a geek elite, however. Hayles looks at cybernetically inspired science fiction by the likes of Philip K. Dick, William Gibson, and Neal Stephenson to show how the larger culture grapples with the same issues that dog the technologists. She also draws lucidly on her own broad grasp of contemporary philosophy both to contextualize those issues and to contend with them herself. The result is a fascinating introduction--and a valuable addition--to one of the most important currents in recent intellectual history. <i>--Julian Dibbell</i></p><b>N.

Most agree that it began as noble effort to jump-start racial integration; many believe it devolved into a patently unfair system of quotas and concealment. Now, with the Supreme Court set to rule on a case that could sharply curtail the use of racial preferences in American universities, law professor Richard Sander and legal journalist Stuart Taylor offer a definitive account of what affirmative action has become, showing that while the objective is laudable, the effects have been anything but.<br><br>Sander and Taylor have long admired affirmative action's original goals, but after many years of studying racial preferences, they have reached a controversial but undeniable conclusion: that preferences hurt underrepresented minorities far more than they help them. At the heart of affirmative action's failure is a simple phenomenon called mismatch. Using dramatic new data and numerous interviews with affected former students and university officials of color, the authors show how racial preferences often put students in competition with far better-prepared classmates, dooming many to fall so far behind that they can never catch up. <i>Mismatch</i> largely explains why, even though black applicants are more likely to enter college than whites with similar backgrounds, they are far less likely to finish; why there are so few black and Hispanic professionals with science and engineering degrees and doctorates; why black law graduates fail bar exams at four times the rate of whites; and why universities accept relatively affluent minorities over working class and poor people of all races.<br><br>Sander and Taylor believe it is possible to achieve the goal of racial equality in higher education, but they argue that alternative policies&#x2014;such as full public disclosure of all preferential admission policies, a focused commitment to improving socioeconomic diversity on campuses, outreach to minority communities, and a renewed focus on K-12 schooling &#x2014;will go farther in achieving that goal than preferences, while also allowing applicants to make informed decisions. Bold, controversial, and deeply researched, <i>Mismatch</i> calls for a renewed examination of this most divisive of social programs&#x2014;and for reforms that will help realize the ultimate goal of racial equality.<br></p><p><b>Richard H.

Written at the intersection of social science and law, its data conclusively demonstrate the damage that has been done to intended beneficiaries by courts' decisions that have made racial preferences in college admissions an exception to the Constitution's guarantee of equal protection of the laws.&#x201d;<br><b> George F. Will</b><br><br> As a longtime defender of affirmative action, I used to think the so-called mismatch problem was an overhyped myth. But Sander and Taylor make a convincing case and, more important, good recommendations to keep affirmative action alive &#x2014; without preferences.&#x201d;<br><b> Clarence Page, <i>Chicago Tribune</i></b><br><br> [Sander and Taylor] are intelligent critics who support the modest use of race in admissions but think very large preferences have harmful effects.... [T]his book is at its best when it skewers college and university officials &#x2014; who feel morally superior for defending affirmative action &#x2014; for in fact pursuing what Yale Law professor Stephen Carter has called racial justice on the cheap.'&#x201d;<br><b> Richard Kahlenberg, <i>The New Republic</i></b><br><br> The highly anticipated Sander-Taylor book, <i>Mismatch: How Affirmative Action Hurts Students It's Intended to Help, and Why Universities Won't Admit It</i>, was published Tuesday, on the eve of the oral argument in Fisher v. Texas. It is, in a word, magisterial. No matter what the Supremes decide, this work will be regarded as a major &#x2014; perhaps the major &#x2014; discussion of the use and abuse of race in American higher education, easily displacing Bowen and Bok's unduly influential The Shape of the River, which it respectfully but effectively eviscerates.... As someone who has attempted to follow racial issues closely, I can assure you that you will learn, as I did, a great deal that you didn't know and be impressed by the wealth of social science evidence ably and judiciously presented to support and extend the mismatch theory.... Mismatch, in short, is a major contribution to the debate over affirmative action, a model of vigorous but fair and balanced argument and analysis.&#x201d;<br><b> John S. Rosenberg, <i>Minding the Campus</i></b><br><br> The evidence on [the wrongs perpetrated by affirmative action programs] is hotly disputed, but Richard Sander and Stuart Taylor Jr. make a compelling case in their book <i>Mismatch</i>.&#x201d;<br><b> David Brooks, <i>New York Times</i></b><br><br> The best argument against affirmative action is presented in <i>Mismatch</i>, by Richard Sander and Stuart Taylor. The subtitle says it all: <i>How Affirmative Action Hurts Students Its Intended to Help and Why Universities Won't Admit It</i>.... If Sander and Taylor are right, affirmative action may be a policy that hurts Asians and helps no one. But this is an uncomfortable thing to say. For one thing, we don't know that they're right &#x2014; there is a hot debate over their thesis. But even if they are right, the remedy is bound to be very divisive..... It's worth noting that it should be relatively easy to tell whether Sander and Taylor are right, except that it's very hard to get the data. And it's hard to get the data because institutions fight like hell to keep it from being released. It's no surprise that we can't all agree on a remedy for historical racism. But it should be easy to agree to study the problem.&#x201d;<br><b> Megan McArdle, <i>The Daily Beast</i></b><br><br> The devastating new book Mismatch has so much overwhelming evidence on the harm done to students who are black, Hispanic, or from other under-represented' minorities, that it will be hard for anyone with pretensions of honesty to be able to deny that painful fact.... Sander and Taylor have written an outstanding book that deserves to be read and pondered in many places for many years. They have performed a major service for all those who have an open mind on affirmative action.&#x201d;<br><b> Thomas Sowell, <i>Claremont Review of Books</i></b><br><br> [An] eye-opening new book.... The argument Sander and Taylor make is unpopular among academic administrators, and, they illustrate, it has been systematically suppressed. But the evidence that they present makes obvious that the solution to educational inequity is not to be found in continuing to mask it with racial admissions preferences that harm students.&#x201d;<br><b> <i>Science Careers</i></b><br><br> Anyone who wants an honest look at the hard facts about racial preferences in admissions to colleges and universities will find it &#x2014; perhaps for the first time &#x2014; in a book titled Mismatch by Richard Sander and Stuart Taylor, Jr.... The careful analysis of documented facts makes <i>Mismatch</i> a rare and valuable book for people who want to think.&#x201d;<br><b> Thomas Sowell, <i>Creators Syndicate</i></b><br><br> In the real world, there is little doubt that racial preferences are a failure. In their judicious book <i>Mismatch</i>, Richard Sander and Stuart Taylor Jr. catalog the twisted effect of preferences on schools beholden to them.&#x201d;<br><b> Rich Lowry, <i>National Review Online</i></b><br><br> [Stuart Taylor's] book is wonderful.... [It's] the most thoughtful account of the possible policy disadvantages of affirmative action in putting students who are mismatched...at universities where they're not prepared.&#x201d;<br><b> Jeffrey Rosen, on NPR's <i>Diane Rehm Show</i></b><br><br> In their outstanding book, Mismatch, Richard Sander and Stuart Taylor Jr. document the paradoxical results of giving large preferences to racial and other minorities. Sander and Taylor argue persuasively that the trouble with preferences is not the injustice done to people like Abigail Fisher, who was denied admission to the University of Texas while less qualified black and Hispanic applicants were accepted &#x2014; though that is unfair &#x2014; but also the harm it does to those to whom such preferences are extended.&#x201d;<br><b> Mona Charen, <i>Creators Syndicate</i></b><br><br> An influential book.&#x201d;<br><b> Michael Kinsley, <i>Bloomberg View</i></b><br><br> [A] wealth of information.... Dr. Sander and Mr. Taylor present an excellent explanation of what is currently meant by affirmative action and demonstrate how it has been abused.&#x201d;<br><b> <i>New York Journal of Books</i></b><br><br> [A] remarkable new book. [Sander and Taylor] have shifted the focus of the entire debate. Bypassing the standard arguments about core principles, their extensive research focuses on the actual effects of racial preferences on the students they were intended to benefit. Drawing upon data never before available to independent-minded scholars, they find, to their dismay, that such policies actually do more harm than good to black and Hispanic students. From now on, it will be impossible to have a serious debate on this subject without extensive reference to the evidence provided in this volume.&#x201d;<br><b> <i>National Review</i></b><br><br> Racial discrimination is unlawful and has been rightly repudiated by the American people. The corrupt silence concerning such discrimination in college and university admissions suggests that at some level these people know they are doing something for which they should be ashamed. Unfortunately they are doing their intended beneficiaries no favors. That's proved beyond demur by Sander and Taylor's <i>Mismatch</i>.&#x201d;<br><b> Michael Barone, <i>Creators Syndicate</i></b><br><br> [<i>Mismatch: How Affirmative Action Hurts Students It's Intended to Help, and Why Universities Won't Admit It</i> is] a fine book, and the evidence gathered under the first part of the subtitle is convincing.... I was even more intrigued by the second part &#x2014; about the reluctance of the universities and respectable opinion in general to recognize the defects of the policy. It's a subject that cannot be discussed, least of all in the precincts of American institutions dedicated to fearless free inquiry.&#x201d;<br><b> Clive Crook, <i>Bloomberg View</i></b><br><br> Sander and Taylor attack affirmative action programs in a bold and comprehensive way.... General readers will learn much from this work, though it is recommended more for graduate students in public policy as well as students and faculty at law schools.&#x201d;<br><b> <i>Choice</i></b><br><br> [W]hat Mr. Sander and Mr. Taylor have accomplished here is incredibly impressive. The authors have done an excellent job of pulling together the available research, and Mr. Sander in particular has been dogged in his pursuit of fresh numbers ].... Mr. Sander and Mr. Taylor, of course, have their share of critics, and Mismatch will not be the last word on this subject. But they have put the nation's universities in a put-up-or-shut-up situation: They can either admit that preferences do harm, or they can release the data that prove otherwise.&#x201d;<br><b> <i>Washington Times</i></b><br><br> Sander and Taylor have marshaled a formidable amount of evidence to substantiate the mismatch theory, and...the payoff is persuasiveness.... <i>Mismatch</i> is very much in the tradition of the muckraking that Lincoln Steffens did a century ago when he took on the corruption in American cities; indeed, the book could be titled The Shame of the Colleges.'&#x201d;<br><b> <i>Wall Street Journal</i></b><br><br> [A] sober, reasoned, more-in-sorrow-than-in-anger critique of affirmative action.... One of the virtues of this book is that it is based on a rigorous, dispassionate examination of the facts. It is packed with easy-to-follow graphics and statistical analysis, as well as extensive case evidence based on interviews.&#x201d;<br><b> <i>The American Spectator</i></b><br><br> [A] powerful new book that explains the nefarious consequences of [undergraduate and graduate admissions programs] for the supposed beneficiaries of racial preferences. The dirty secret &#x2014; not a dirty little secret, but a dirty huge secret &#x2014; is how massive in size their racial preferences are.&#x201d;<br><b> Ed Whelan, <i>National Review Online, Bench Memos</i></b><br><br> The authors offer extensive data in support of their conclusions that the present system is not serving those students well.... This information will be argued over all the same, but the authors' evenhanded suggestion that what might be a better strategy is to raise educational attainment by investing more in elementary and secondary education for lower-income students &#x2014; targeting economic need before racial identity,' as they put it &#x2014; seems unobjectionable on the face. The subject may be hard to talk about, but it must be, and this is a valuable contribution to opening that needed discussion.&#x201d;<br><b> <i>Kirkus Reviews</i></b><br><br> <i>Mismatch</i> is a story of good intentions gone terribly awry. Sander and Taylor document beyond disagreement how university admissions offices' racial quotas and preferences systematically put black and Hispanic students in schools where they are far less well-prepared than others.&#x201d;<br><b> Michael Barone, <i>Washington Examiner</i></b><br><br> This lucid, data-rich book is simply the best researched and most convincing analysis ever done of affirmative action in higher education, a work at once impeccably scholarly and entirely accessible to anyone interested in the social and legal ramifications of well-intentioned policies that, as the authors show, have a boomerang effect on the intended beneficiaries.&#x201d;<br><b> Judge Richard A. Posner</b><br><br> As a high-profile defender of affirmative action, I used to think the so-called mismatch' problem was a bit overblown. Richard Sander and Stuart Taylor have caused me to think again. How many bright and promising minority students, we must ask, have failed because they were steered with the best intentions, of course &#x2014; into elite schools for which they were less prepared academically than most of their classmates? What better ways can we devise to boost academic achievement and expand the pool of qualified students of all races? We don't do future generations of students any favors by trying to ignore this issue or pretend it doesn't exist. If common-sense moderates don't step up and engage this debate, we only allow extremists to take control of it.&#x201d;<br><b> Clarence Page, Pulitzer Prize-winning columnist for the <i>Chicago Tribune</i></b></p><h2>Teaching English as a Second or Foreign Language, 4th edition</h2><p>Now in its fourth edition, this comprehensive, best-selling methodology resource gives both prospective and experienced ESL/ELT teachers the theoretical background and practical applications they need to decide which approaches, materials, and resources can and should be used in their classrooms.</p><p>The following chapters are new to this edition:<br> <ul><li>Principles of Instructed Second Language Learning </li><li> Teaching English in the Context of World Englishes </li><li> Fluency-Oriented Second Language Teaching </li><li> Developing Engaged Second Language Readers </li><li> Spoken Grammar </li><li> Assessment in Second Language Classrooms </li><li> Tools and Techniques in Effective Second Language Teaching </li><li> Teaching Language Through Discourse </li><li> Task-Based Language Teaching and Learning </li><li> Motivation in Second Language Learning </li><li> Teaching Young Learners in ESL and EFL Settings</li></ul><ul><li>New and revised contributions from forty-six well-known scholars and practitioners offer a variety of perspectives on language teaching and learning and an expanded focus on teaching in international contexts. </li><li> Each chapter lists questions, activities, and useful references. </li><li> The Website for the text includes resources for extra information, expanded biographies of authors, and a glossary of key terms.</li></ul></p><h2>Learn Ancient Greek (Greek and Latin Language)</h2><p><p>Based on the same principles as<i> Learn Latin</i>, Peter Jones's bestselling book of the hugely popular Daily Telegraph series, this book teaches you enough Greek in 20 chapters to be able to read some real ancient Greek &#x2013; one of the world's greatest languages, used by one of the world's greatest cultures.

The thing was draped around his neck like a shedding boa constrictor.<br><br>&#x2018;Of course,&#x2019; Simon said, &#x2018;some less charitable critics have suggested that your first volume should have been filed under Fantasy.&#x2019;<br><br>Bryant shrugged. &#x2018;What is reality?&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;Well, it&#x2019;s the state of things as they actually exist, as opposed to an idealistic or notional sense of them.&#x2019; The editor liked to be clear about these matters.<br><br>&#x2018;That&#x2019;s easy for you to say.&#x2019; Bryant checked his huge white false teeth in the blade of his knife. &#x2018;My memories are like patches of old road that have to be repaired now and again. Everyone knows that memories become real over time.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;Nevertheless, if readers buy your memoirs expecting a realistic account of life in one of London&#x2019;s special detection units and find themselves with a volume of speculative fiction, they should really be informed,&#x2019; said Simon, not unreasonably.<br><br>&#x2018;I don&#x2019;t see why,&#x2019; Bryant replied. &#x2018;They happily believe the tabloids.&#x2019;<br><br>Simon understood that cheeriness would always achieve more than antagonism, so he ploughed on. &#x2018;I do think that telling them you were investigating crimes during the Blitz is pushing it a bit.&#x2019; He searched in vain for a waiter. &#x2018;Perhaps a tad more honesty next time?&#x2019;<br><br>Bryant mimed affront. &#x2018;I&#x2019;ll have you know I keep detailed notes. Mistakes sometimes occur in translation.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;Why do your notes need translating?&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;I write them in Aramaic. It&#x2019;s a three-�thousand-�year-�old language so I have to make up a lot of words.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;But you change things around,&#x2019; said Simon helplessly. &#x2018;The Leicester Square Vampire, for example. I&#x2019;ve read at least three accounts of that particular investigation, all of them quite different.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;That&#x2019;s because there&#x2019;s my version, the official version and the truth.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;And you hold information back.&#x2019; Simon raised his eyebrows and index finger to a waiter who, being French, ignored him. &#x2018;For example, why won&#x2019;t you admit your age to anyone?&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;Because at my age you only admit it to your doctor. It takes me so long to scroll down to my year of birth on computers that I start to wonder if they&#x2019;ll actually have it. Are you sure there&#x2019;s still a market for my memoirs?&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;Oh, absolutely,&#x2019; said Simon with conviction. &#x2018;These are strange times, and readers need to be taken out of themselves.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;I suppose in a world of clickbait and slut-�shaming my little anecdotes are charmingly anachronistic.&#x2019; Bryant didn&#x2019;t actually know what those things were; he had heard someone at work mention them.<br><br>Simon felt a frown furrowing his brain and fought it back. &#x2018;Then I dare say we&#x2019;ll soldier on with another volume if you can stand it. It was terribly unfortunate that your previous biographers had such rotten luck&nbsp;. . .&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;What with one being murdered, you mean,&#x2019; said Bryant. Slouched back in his chair, he appeared about to vanish beneath the table. His fringe was white and vertical, his azure eyes as round as buttons. The editor felt as if he were having lunch with a teddy bear.<br><br>&#x2018;Ah, the murder. That was a bit of a sticky wicket.&#x2019; Simon caught the waiter&#x2019;s eye again and tried to magnetize him. &#x2018;None of us expected her to up stumps and retire to the pavilion like that. Still, the innings isn&#x2019;t over yet, is it?&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;We never played cricket at school,&#x2019; said Bryant, who had hardly ever attended school, let alone played a competitive sport.<br><br>&#x2018;Oh, right.&#x2019; Simon assumed everyone had played for their county at least once, so Bryant&#x2019;s remark made no sense to him.<br><br>&#x2018;I can&#x2019;t write the memoirs myself,&#x2019; said Bryant. &#x2018;I tend to wander off.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;We&#x2019;ll have to find you someone who can.&#x2019; He returned to the safer ground of the wine list. &#x2018;They do a rather pleasing Crozes-�Hermitage here. Young but robust,&#x2019; he added before realizing that his lunch companion was neither.<br><br>The waiter finally dragged himself over and took the wine order. Bryant looked about while his editor discussed the wine in flawless French. The restaurant was a mahogany funeral parlour swathed in brocaded crimson curtains, dimly lit by art nouveau lamps. It served its steaks rare and its puddings well done, and if you didn&#x2019;t like it you probably went to a comprehensive school and jolly well needed to learn some manners.<br><br>Simon tucked in his napkin immaculately but somewhat prematurely, an indication that he had attended a boarding school. &#x2018;I was wondering if you had a subject in mind for a follow-�up volume, something that would really raise your batting average? You must have a nice juicy crime up your sleeve, an investigation that you&#x2019;ve never been able to talk about. One of those cases that took place in the days before psychological profiling or counselling.&#x2019; He broke open a pensionable bread roll. &#x2018;If you can come to the crease with a first-�class game we might take the Ashes with this one.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;Phones,&#x2019; said Bryant, exploding his bread and swathing it in butter.<br><br>&#x2018;I&#x2019;m sorry?&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;You said &#x201c;before psychological profiling or counselling.&#x201d; For us it was phones. They changed everything. Policing is about evidence. Finding out what&#x2019;s real or false, who&#x2019;s telling the truth, who&#x2019;s withholding information. Back in the 1970s we were taught to shout at crime-�scene bystanders: &#x201c;Did anyone see what happened?&#x201d; I don&#x2019;t need to tell you how that turned out. We used to rely on public requests, sightings, interviews, till receipts, bus tickets. As soon as people started using mobiles they left a trail wherever they went. We didn&#x2019;t have to trust hearsay any more. Before, we had to rely on finding a telephone box. Now we search online records.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;Yes, but it&#x2019;s not terribly dramatic,&#x2019; Simon pointed out, &#x2018;running through phone numbers on a screen.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;It&#x2019;s still more interesting than life in the Met,&#x2019; said Bryant cheerfully. &#x2018;Their crime scenes end up looking like film sets. Too many officers hanging around with nothing to do. The annual London murder rate is too low, always around the one hundred mark in a city that&#x2019;s heading for nine million residents. Pathetic. So naturally everybody wants to attend one. A lot of coppers never get the chance any more. It&#x2019;s like signing up for a safari expecting to see a lion roar and coming back having seen two monkeys and something scratching itself in a mud pool.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;That&#x2019;s a good thing, though, isn&#x2019;t it? Surely one doesn&#x2019;t want murderers to score more than a century?&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;Knife culture has left every disenfranchised teenager with a chip on his shoulder thinking it&#x2019;s acceptable to carry one of these.&#x2019; Bryant twanged his knife on the table for emphasis, making nearby diners look over. &#x2018;Stabbings are banal tragedies committed over trivialities. Even George Orwell bemoaned the declining quality of English murder.&#x2019;<br><br>Simon&#x2019;s brow knitted. &#x2018;But the Peculiar Crimes Unit specialized in cases liable to cause public disorder, no? Wasn&#x2019;t there ever an investigation that changed you, perhaps when you were younger?&#x2019; He stared at his luncheon guest and tried to imagine what he had been like as a young man, but the effort was too demanding.<br><br>&#x2018;Funnily enough I was thinking about one such case just the other day,&#x2019; said Bryant. &#x2018;Although it was a bit of an oddity, even for us, and the outcome wasn&#x2019;t at all what anyone expected.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;I wouldn&#x2019;t worry too much about that,&#x2019; said Simon hopefully. &#x2018;I&#x2019;m sure we can find a biographer who&#x2019;ll spice it up a bit, give our readers a bit more bang for their buck, so to speak.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;That&#x2019;s not normally necessary. We&#x2019;ve come across some killers who&#x2019;ve made Titus Andronicus look like Rupert Bear. But now that I think back, this one did play out rather like an Agatha Christie novel.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;Unguessable?&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;Unbelievable. Not that there&#x2019;s anything wrong with that. The beauty of Christie is that beneath all the rubbish about strychnine and vicars there&#x2019;s usually a simple unconscious truth.&#x2019; Bryant&#x2019;s aqueous blue eyes searched the ceiling as he ransacked his memory. &#x2018;It was the sort of thing that could only have happened in the 1960s, when everything was less examined. We were young and na�ve. There was so much that was new to us. By today&#x2019;s standards the situation was utterly absurd, of course. In those days we were academics, mainly working on abstract scenarios. If we&#x2019;d been more experienced in the field and had taken everything a little more seriously, I imagine the outcome might have been different.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;It sounds promising.&#x2019; The wine arrived. &#x2018;Ah, Ch�teau Screwtop.&#x2019; Simon gave a small wince of apology that said, Publishing margins are tight and you don&#x2019;t shift enough copies to warrant something with a cork.<br><br>Bryant was oblivious. &#x2018;The investigation began and ended in a single weekend, although I suppose its roots went back further than that. It was at the end of the summer of 1969, an extraordinary time to be young. I dare say you recall that year&nbsp;. . .&#x2019;<br><br>For a brief moment Simon&#x2019;s naturally cheery face clouded. &#x2018;I&#x2019;m not actually old enough, Mr Bryant.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;Really?&#x2019; Bryant peered closely at him. &#x2018;You do surprise me. You must be married. Of course it&#x2019;s hard to explain just how strange the sixties were to people who weren&#x2019;t around then. What is it they say? &#x201c;If you can remember the sixties you weren&#x2019;t there.&#x201d; Mind you, I can&#x2019;t remember going to the barber&#x2019;s yesterday. I looked in the mirror this morning and got quite a shock.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;I was just starting prep school,&#x2019; said Simon helplessly.<br><br>&#x2018;Back then I was not the wrinkled wreck you see before you,&#x2019; Bryant continued, oblivious. &#x2018;I was young and lithe. Young, anyway. I&#x2019;ve always been a tad portly.&#x2019; He prodded his stomach with his knife. &#x2018;Luckily, waistcoats were fashionable. I had energy, zip, get-�up-�and-�go. It was a thrilling time to be alive. Everything was fresh; everything was new. I bought a kipper tie. I met a girl. I punched a capitalist. I smoked my first joint.&#x2019;<br><br>&#x2018;I think we can leave out that part,&#x2019; said Simon.<br><br>Bryant loosened a coil of his scarf and raised his hands as if framing a picture. &#x2018;Let me set the scene for you. Overnight the country went from monochrome to Technicolor, from austerity to abundance. The Rolling Stones. The Kinks. David Hockney. Mary Quant.&#x2019;</p><h2>Ball of Collusion: The Plot to Rig an Election and Destroy a Presidency</h2><p>The real <i>collusion</i> in the 2016 election was not between the Trump campaign and the Kremlin. It was between the Clinton campaign and the Obama administration.<br> <br> The media&#x2013;Democrat &#x201c;collusion narrative,&#x201d; which paints Donald Trump as cat&#x2019;s paw of Russia, is a studiously crafted illusion.<br> <br> Despite Clinton&#x2019;s commanding lead in the polls, hyper-partisan intelligence officials decided they needed an &#x201c;insurance policy&#x201d; against a Trump presidency. Thus was born the collusion narrative, built on an anonymously sourced &#x201c;dossier,&#x201d; secretly underwritten by the Clinton campaign and compiled by a former British spy. Though acknowledged to be &#x201c;salacious and unverified&#x201d; at the FBI&#x2019;s highest level, the dossier was used to build a counterintelligence investigation against Trump&#x2019;s campaign.<br> <br> Miraculously, Trump won anyway. But his political opponents refused to accept the voters&#x2019; decision. Their collusion narrative was now peddled relentlessly by political operatives, intelligence agents, Justice Department officials, and media ideologues&#x2015;the vanguard of the &#x201c;Trump Resistance.&#x201d; Through secret surveillance, high-level intelligence leaking, and tireless news coverage, the public was led to believe that Trump conspired with Russia to steal the election.<br> <br> Not one to sit passively through an onslaught, President Trump fought back in his tumultuous way. Matters came to a head when he fired his FBI director, who had given explosive House testimony suggesting the president was a criminal suspect, despite privately assuring Trump otherwise. The resulting firestorm of partisan protest cowed the Justice Department to appoint a special counsel, whose seemingly limitless investigation bedeviled the administration for two years.<br> <br> Yet as months passed, concrete evidence of collusion failed to materialize. Was the collusion narrative an elaborate fraud? And if so, choreographed by whom? Against media&#x2013;Democrat caterwauling, a doughty group of lawmakers forced a shift in the spotlight from Trump to his investigators and accusers. This has exposed the depth of politicization within American law-enforcement and intelligence agencies. It is now clear that the institutions on which our nation depends for objective policing and clear-eyed analysis injected themselves scandalously into the divisive politics of the 2016 election.<br> <br> They failed to forge a new Clinton administration. Will they succeed in bringing down President Trump?</p><p>Andrew C. McCarthy is a former federal prosecutor who received the Justice Department&#x2019;s highest honors.

Married to his high school sweetheart and one of the winningest quarterbacks in the history of college football, he was the number one NFL draft pick. But on the night of the draft, he plummeted from the pinnacle of esteem.

There she has discovered a young man with the talent to achieve the football career Matthew should have had. All he needs is the right coach.

That all changed in less than a generation with the discovery and development of a new category of medicine known as antibiotics. By 1955, the age-old evolutionary relationship between humans and microbes had been transformed, trivializing once-deadly infections.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;William Rosen captures this revolution with all its false starts, lucky surprises, and eccentric characters. He explains why, given the complex nature of bacteria&#x2014;and their ability to rapidly evolve into new forms&#x2014;the only way to locate and test potential antibiotic strains is by large-scale, systematic, trial-and-error experimentation. Organizing that research needs large, well-funded organizations and businesses, and so our entire scientific-industrial complex, built around the pharmaceutical company, was born.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; <i>T</i>imely, engrossing, and eye-opening, <i>Miracle Cure</i> is a must-read science narrative&#x2014;a drama of enormous range, combining science, technology, politics, and economics to illuminate the reasons behind one of the most dramatic changes in humanity&#x2019;s relationship with nature since the invention of agriculture ten thousand years ago.</p><p><b>William Rosen</b>, author of <i>The Third Horseman</i>, <i>Justinian&#x2019;s Flea</i>, and <i>The Most Powerful Idea in the World</i>, was an editor and a publisher at Macmillan, Simon &amp; Schuster, and the Free Press for nearly twenty-five years.&#x201c;Rosen&#x2019;s highly informed retelling captures the drama of scientists&#x2019; quest, against long odds, to find and produce bacteria-killing drugs&#x2014;and the egos, ambitions, brilliance and resolve that drove them. . . . It is a strength of &#x201c;Miracle Cure&#x201d; that Rosen places its many tales of discovery in their larger contexts . . . an important contribution to a still-germane yet fast-receding history. And it&#x2019;s all the more impressive that Rosen, formerly a book editor and publisher, wrote it as he was battling his own intractable disease.&#x201d;<b><br><b>&#x2014;<i>The Wall Street Journal</i></b><br><br></b>&#x201c;In <i>Miracle Cure</i>, William Rosen tells the lavish story of antibiotics with the flair and skill of a seasoned novelist, portraying his characters as all too-human, the research often fallible but occasionally transcendent. . . . Rosen's chronological approach gives the narrative its fluency; his wit and vivid detail make <i>Miracle Cure</i> an absorbing read. . . . A triumph of science writing that deserves a broad popular audience.&#x201d;<b><br><b><b>&#x2014;<i>Minneapolie Star Tribune</i></b></b><br><br>"</b>In this assured chronicle of the twentieth-century antibiotics revolution, William Rosen delivers reams of science at a thrilleresque pace. The experimentalists&#x2014;Gerhard Domagk and Howard Florey among them&#x2014;are vividly portrayed, as are the patients cured, the pharmaceutical corporations created and the moment in 1943 when bacteriologist Mary Hunt found the ancestor of all penicillin used today, on a mouldy melon.

Masterworks)</h2><p>One of the very best must-read SF novels of all time.</p><p>In the 1960s, Roger Zelazny dazzled the SF world with what seemed to be inexhaustible talent and inventiveness. <i>Lord of Light</i>, his third novel, is his finest book: a science fantasy in which the intricate, colorful mechanisms of Hindu religion, capricious gods, and repeated reincarnations are wittily underpinned by technology. "For six days he had offered many kilowatts of prayer, but the static kept him from being heard On High." The gods are a starship crew who subdued a colony world; developed godlike--though often machine-enhanced--powers during successive lifetimes of mind transfer to new, cloned bodies; and now lord it over descendants of the ship's mere passengers. Their tyranny is opposed by retired god Sam, who mocks the Celestial City, introduces Buddhism to subvert Hindu dogma, allies himself with the planet's native "demons" against Heaven, fights pyrotechnic battles with bizarre troops and weapons, plays dirty with politics and poison, and dies horribly but won't stay dead. It's a huge, lumbering, magical story, told largely in flashback, full of wonderfully ornate language (and one unforgivable pun) that builds up the luminous myth of trickster Sam, Lord of Light. Essential SF reading. <i>--David Langford, Amazon.co.uk</i><p>Earth is long since dead. On a colony planet, a band of men has gained control of technology, made themselves immortal, and now rules their world as the gods of the Hindu pantheon. Only one dares oppose them: he who was once Siddhartha and is now Mahasamatman. Binder of Demons.

Without scientific theory, these developments would not have been possible.<br><br>In this exceptionally clear and engaging introduction to philosophy of science, James Ladyman explores the philosophical questions that arise when we reflect on the nature of the scientific method and the knowledge it produces. He discusses whether fundamental philosophical questions about knowledge and reality might be answered by science, and considers in detail the debate between realists and antirealists about the extent of scientific knowledge. Along the way, central topics in philosophy of science, such as the demarcation of science from non-science, induction, confirmation and falsification, the relationship between theory and observation and relativism are all addressed. Important and complex current debates over underdetermination, inference to the best explaination and the implications of radical theory change are clarified and clearly explained for those new to the subject.</p><p>James Ladyman is Senior Lecturer in philosophy at the University of BristolAn excellent introduction to philosophy of science that can be recommended as a starting point to the general reader... The writing is exceptionally clear and the text is enlivened by periodic snippets of dialogue between enthusiastic science lover Alice and her more sceptical friend Thomas.</p><h2>Single Variable Calculus</h2><p>Success in your calculus course starts here!

The water filled the swirling tracks to form the mighty bending rivers spread across the vast plains of the Gulf country. The serpent travelled over the marine plains, over the salt flats, through the salt dunes, past the mangrove forests and crawled inland. Then it went back to the sea. And it came out at another spot along the coastline and crawled inland and back again. When it finished creating the many rivers in its wake, it created one last river, no larger or smaller than the others, a river which offers no apologies for its discontent with people who do not know it. This is where the giant serpent continues to live deep down under the ground in a vast network of limestone aquifers. They say its being is porous; it permeates everything. It is all around in the atmosphere and is attached to the lives of the river people like skin.<br> <br>This tidal river snake of flowing mud takes in breaths of a size that is difficult to comprehend. Imagine the serpent&#x2019;s breathing rhythms as the tide flows inland, edging towards the spring waters nestled deeply in the gorges of an ancient limestone plateau covered with rattling grasses dried yellow from the prevailing winds. Then with the outward breath, the tide turns and the serpent flows back to its own circulating mass of shallow waters in the giant water basin in a crook of the mainland whose sides separate it from the open sea.<br> <br>To catch this breath in the river you need the patience of one who can spend days doing nothing. If you wait under the rivergum where those up-to-no-good Mission-bred kids accidentally hanged Cry-baby Sally, the tip of the dead branch points to where you will see how the serpent&#x2019;s breath fights its way through in a tunnel of wind, creating ripples that shimmer silver, similar to the scales of a small, nocturnal serpent, thrashing in anger whenever the light hits its slippery translucent body, making it writhe and wrench to escape back into its natural environment of darkness.<br> <br>The inside knowledge about this river and coastal region is the Aboriginal Law handed down through the ages since time began. Otherwise, how would one know where to look for the hidden underwater courses in the vast flooding mud plains, full of serpents and fish in the monsoon season? Can someone who did not grow up in a place that is sometimes underwater, sometimes bone-dry, know when the trade winds blowing off the southern and northern hemispheres will merge in summer? Know the moment of climatic change better than they know themselves? Who fishes in the yellow-coloured monsoonal runoff from the drainages, with sheets of deep water pouring into the wide rivers swollen over their banks, filling vast plains with flood waters? The cyclones linger and regroup, the rain never stops pouring, but the fat fish are abundant.<br> <br>It takes a particular kind of knowledge to go with the river, whatever its mood. It is about there being no difference between you and the movement of water as it seasonally shifts its tracks according to its own mood. A river that spurns human endeavour in one dramatic gesture, jilting a lover who has never really been known, as it did to the frontier town built on its banks in the hectic heyday of colonial vigour. A town intended to serve as a port for the shipping trade for the hinterland of Northern Australia.<br> <br>In one moment, during a Wet season early in the last century, the town lost its harbour waters when the river simply decided to change course, to bypass it by several kilometres. Just like that. Now the waterless port survives with more or less nothing to do. Its citizens continue to engage in a dialogue with themselves passed down the generations on why the town should continue to exist. They stayed on to safeguard the northern coastline from invasion by the Yellow Peril. A dreadful vision, a long yellow streak marching behind an arrowhead pointing straight for the little town of Desperance. Eventually the heat subsided. When the Yellow Peril did not invade, everyone had a good look around and found a more contemporary reason for existence. It meant the town still had to be vigilant. Duty did not fall on one or two; duty was everybody&#x2019;s business. To keep a good eye out for whenever the moment presented itself, to give voice to a testimonial far beyond personal experience&#x2014;to comment on the state of their blacks. To do so was regarded as an economic contribution to State rights, then, as an afterthought, to maintaining the decent society of the nation as a whole.<br> <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br> <br>Normal Phantom was an old tribal man, who lived all of his life in the dense Pricklebush scrub on the edge of town. He lived amidst thickets of closely growing slender plants with barely anything for leaves, which never gave an ant an inch of shelter under a thousand thorny branches. This foreign infestation on the edge of Desperance grew out of an era long before anyone in the Phantom family could remember. They had lived in a human dumping ground next to the town tip since the day Normal Phantom was born. All choked up, living piled up together in trash humpies made of tin, cloth, and plastic too, salvaged from the rubbish dump. The descendants of the pioneer families, who claimed ownership of the town, said the Aboriginal was really not part of the town at all. Sure, they worked the dunny cart in the old days, carted the rubbish, and swept the street. Furthermore, they said, the Aboriginal was dumped here by the pastoralists, because they refused to pay the blackfella equal wages, even when it came in. Right on the edge of somebody else&#x2019;s town, didn&#x2019;t they? Dumped the lot of them without any sign of lock, stock, or barrel.<br> <br>No, the Pricklebush was from the time before the motor car, when goods and chattels came up by camel train until Abdul and Abdullah, the old Afghan brothers, disappeared along the track called the &#x201c;lifeline,&#x201d; connecting north to south. After much time had passed the jokes came about Afghans being shifty dogs, dodgy dogs, murdering dogs, and unreliable. When the cupboards turned bare, the town talk finally turned to the realisation that very likely the camel men were never coming back&#x2014;then everyone in town assumed they had died. A few of the Christian-minded, trying to capitalise on the gross lack of decency in town, sniffed, Well! That ought to teach you now, won&#x2019;t it? But no one else thought so, because by then the grog and the tucker were being freighted up by mail truck, which everyone thought was a more convenient method of road transport by any stretch of the imagination.<br> <br>One cloud-covered night, the camels finally turned up in Desperance, jingling and a-jangling, their foreign bells swaying around their necks, vespers on such a still night. The residents woke up in childlike fright, sitting straight up in their beds, eyes wide open like zombies, seeing dark figures moving in their pitch-black bedroom, same time reckoning it was ghosts with an Afghan smell, true God, just came straight in, levitating, taking over, helping themselves, walking around people&#x2019;s homes with no mind youse, not one shred of good manners whatsoever. Couldn&#x2019;t even knock on the door first before coming into someone&#x2019;s house. That was the trouble with new Australians, the town claimed: Even dead ones had no manners. Unnaturalised. Really un-Australian. You shoulda sent out a search party. What a relief it was for dawn to come and everyone could see for themselves it was just poor old Abdul&#x2019;s and Abdullah&#x2019;s camels.<br> <br>Over the following days no one thought to capture the animals to retrieve the rotting pack saddles. The townsfolk had a deeply felt aversion to touching the belongings of dark-skinned foreigners&#x2014;or their animals. So, the camels just wandered around at their own will, covered with sores from the rotting packs of foodstuff: flour, sugar, grain growing sprouts that had died, still strapped over and hanging off their backs until something had to be done. The poor beasts were officially rounded up. The screaming, uncooperative animals didn&#x2019;t comprehend English, or barbarism either. After being hounded for several hours by their pursuers on foot and horseback, and stoned and whipped, the camels were eventually moved out over the claypans and shot. In the archival records written with a thick nib by a heavy-handed municipal clerk it is recorded, Camels removed. The first entry of work completed by the Town&#x2019;s Municipal Council.<br> <br>In the old camel-drivers&#x2019; camps the seeds of mimosa embedded in camel dung sprouted their hard little shoots in the Wet season. Thousands of seeds spread along every track and gully, flooding with sheetwater from the rain to regenerate in shallow mud pools. The shoots sent down their fat roots to take a steely grip on the claypans, holding the land together in a mirage that looked like it might last forever without water. In this mirage the cattle properties prospered on traditional lands taken but never ceded. Today, herds of Brahman-cross cattle leave their tracks crisscrossing the landscape in the dry season, as they search for stubbly patches of bluegrass and grind the top layers of soil to powdered bulldust.<br> <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br> <br>The Pricklebush mob says that Normal Phantom could grab hold of the river in his mind and live with it as his father&#x2019;s fathers did before him. His ancestors were the river people, who were living with the river from before time began. Normal was like ebbing water; he came and went on the flowing waters of the river right out to the sea. He stayed away on the water as long as he pleased. He knew fish, and was on friendly terms with gropers, the giant codfish of the Gulf sea that swam in schools of fifty or more, on the move right up the river following his boat in for company. The old people say the groper lives for hundreds of years and maybe Normal would too. When he talked about the stars, they said he knew as much about the sky as he did about water. The prickly bush mob said he had always chased the constellations: We watched him as a little boy running off into the night trying to catch stars. They were certain he knew the secret of getting there. They thought he must go right up to the stars in the company of groper fish when it stormed at sea, when the sea and the sky became one, because, otherwise, how could he have come back?<br> <br>&#x201c;How you do that?&#x201d; was the question everyone asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;The water doesn&#x2019;t worry me,&#x201d; Normal Phantom answered simply, although he knew that when his mind went for a walk, his body followed.<br> <br>Everyone in Desperance was used to the sight of Normal&#x2019;s jeep driving north to meet the river&#x2019;s edge. It was the only vehicle he had ever owned. Always, the small tinnie boat, full of dints, a stray bullet hole or two, strapped onto the roof. A vessel purchased with cross-country road transport in mind, much more than water safety.<br> <br>They say he knew these deep muddy waters better than the big salties: crocs that got tangled up in the nets in the middle of the night. Glassy-eyed monsters that came over the side of his tiny craft looking for action with the big river man. Jaws charging for a winner-takes-all kind of fight in the swamping boat, snapping in full flight, water splashing up into a storm with the swishing, thrash, thrash, thrashing of an angry tail against the side of the boat. People like to remember Normal saying in melancholy fashion (faking a thoroughly modern Americanised impersonation of a presidential Captain Hook): those snapping jaws meant diddly squat to him. Meanwhile, he moved like a hopping hare, fumbling for what seemed like ages to find the gun. Normal ended hundreds of lives of prehistoric living fossils this way, with his gun pointing all over the place in a turmoil of water and thick leather crankiness, until he made a direct hit between the eyes of the reptile caught in an instant of moonlight.<br> <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br> <br>In this otherwise quietly living population of about three hundred people, no living soul remembered what the port had looked like before. No picture could be put on display in a showcase at the museum of scarce memorabilia, because no one at the time of the heyday thought it was worthwhile to take a photo. But everybody knew that this was Normal&#x2019;s river.<br> <br>One day, someone in town, whose name is not worth a mention, was languishing around in a laconic stupor following the months of heatwave in the Wet season build-up, waiting for the rain to come. Lying flat out like a corpse on the bare linoleum floor in the hallway of a house exactly like the one next door. Capturing in a long sigh of appreciation the northern sea breezes that came waltzing straight over twenty-five kilometres of mudflats, whistling their arrival through the front door while, on the way out, slamming the back door open and shut. All of a sudden this someone of no consequence thought of changing the name of the river to Normal. And, in a town where change never came easy, it came to be.<br> <br>There was a celebration by the local Shire Council. The occasion was the anniversary of the port&#x2019;s first one hundred years. It coincided with a spate of unusual happenings during a short-lived era of Aboriginal domination of the Council. Harmless coercing of the natives, the social planners hummed, anxious to make deals happen for the impending mining boom. Meaningful coexistence could now accommodate almost any request whatsoever, including changing a river&#x2019;s name to Normal. During this honeymoon period, those Aboriginal people who took the plunge to be councillors wisely used their time in public office to pursue scraps of personal gain for their own families living amidst the muck of third-world poverty.<br> <br>All this was part and parcel of the excitement of Desperance when the first multinational mining company came into the region. Numerous short-lived profiteering schemes were concocted for the locals, in order to serve the big company&#x2019;s own interests as they set about pillaging the region&#x2019;s treasure trove: the publicly touted curve of an underground range embedded with minerals.<br> <br>The elaborate white linen ceremony, paid for by the mining company, attracted Southern politicians who flew in for the day. Most of them were known by the local dignitaries as a bunch of fly-by-nighters. And what&#x2019;s more, as they rolled out the welcome smile, some locals whispered unmentionable insults behi...</p><h2>The Forest of Symbols: Aspects of Ndembu Ritual (Cornell Paperbacks)</h2><p><p>A pioneering work of high quality, this collection of anthropological studies provides one of the most detailed records available for an African society&#x2015;or indeed for any group&#x2015;of the semantics of ritual symbolism.

Minimum feature sizes are now reaching the 100-rim realm. Circuits are becoming more complex, challenging the productivity of the designer, while the plunge into the deep-submicron space causes devices to behave differently and brings to the forefront a number of new issues that impact the reliability, cost, performance, power dissipation, and reliability of the digital IC. This updated text reflects the ongoing (r)evolution in the world of digital integrated circuit design, caused by this move into the deep-submicron realm. This means increased importance of deep-submicron transistor effects, interconnect, signal integrity, high-performance and low-power design, timing, and clock distribution. In contrast to the first edition, the present text focuses entirely on CMOS ICs. </p> <b> <i> <b>http://bwrc.eecs.berkeley.edu/IcBook</b> &#x2014;A Dynamic Companion</i> </b> <p> Even more than for the first edition, this book uses its companion website to evolve and grow over time. It contains complete Microsoft PowerPoint presentations covering all the material, updates. corrections, design projects, and extensive instructor material. Most importantly, all problem sets are now available on the website (and have been removed from the text). </p> <b> <i>Outstanding Features of the Text</i> </b> <ul> <li>It focuses solely on deep-submicron CMOS devices, the workhorses of today's digital integrated circuits.

IC manufacturing technology has continued to scale to ever-smaller dimensions. Minimum feature sizes have scaled by a factor of almost ten since the writing of the first edition, and now are approaching the 100 nm realm. This scaling has a double impact on the design of digital integrated circuit. First of all, the complexity of the designs that can be put on a single die has increased dramatically. Dealing with the challenges this poses has led to new design methodologies and implementation strategies. At the same time, the plunge into the deep-submicron space causes devices to behave differently, and brings to the forefront a number of new issues that impact the reliability, cost, performance, and power dissipation of the digital IC. Addressing these issues in-depth is what differentiates this edition from the first. </p> <p> A glance through the table of contents reveals extended coverage of issues such as deep-sub micron devices, circuit optimization, interconnect modeling and optimization, signal integrity, clocking and timing, and power dissipation. All these topics are illustrated with state-of-the-art design examples. Also, since MOS now represents more than 99% of the digital IC market, older technologies such as silicon bipolar and GaAs have been deleted (however, the interested reader can find the old chapters on these technologies on the web site of the book). Given the importance of methodology in today's design process, we have included <i>Design Methodology Inserts</i> throughout the text, each of which highlights one particular aspect of the design process. This new edition represents a major reworking of the book. The biggest change is the addition of two co-authors, Anantha and Bora, who have brought a broader insight into digital IC design and its latest trends and challenges. </p> <p><b>Maintaining the Spirit of the First Edition</b></p> <p> While introducing these changes, our intent has been to preserve the spirit and goals of the first edition&#x2014;that is, to bridge the gap between the <b>circuit and system visions</b> on digital design. While starting from a solid understanding of the operation of electronic devices and an in-depth analysis of the nucleus of digital design&#x2014;the inverter&#x2014;we gradually channel this knowledge into the design of more complex modules such as gates, registers, controllers, adders, multipliers, and memories. We identify the compelling questions facing the designers of today's complex circuits: What are the dominant design parameters, what section of the design should he focus on and what details could she ignore? Simplification is clearly the only approach to address the increasing complexity of the digital systems. However, oversimplification can lead to circuit failure since global circuit effects such as timing, interconnect, and power consumption are ignored. To avoid this pitfall it is important to design digital circuits with both a circuits and a systems perspective in mind. This is the approach taken in this book, which brings the reader the knowledge and expertise needed to deal with complexity, using both analytical and experimental techniques. </p> <p><b>How to Use This Book</b></p> <p> The core of the text is intended for use in a <i>senior-level digital circuit design class.</i> Around this kernel, we have included chapters and sections covering the more advanced topics. In the course of developing this book, it quickly became obvious that it is difficult to define a subset of the digital circuit design domain that covers everyone's needs. On the one hand, a newcomer to the field needs detailed coverage of the basic concepts. On the other hand, feedback from early readers and reviewers indicated that an in-depth and extensive coverage of advanced topics and current issues is desirable and necessary. Providing this complete vision resulted in a text that exceeds the scope of a single-semester class. The more advanced material can be used as the basis for a <i>graduate class.</i> The wide coverage and the inclusion of state-of-the-art topics also makes the text useful as a reference work for professional engineers. It is assumed that students taking this course are familiar with the basics of logic design. </p> <p> The organization of the material is such that the chapters can be taught or read in many ways, as long as a number of precedence relations are adhered to. The core of the text consists of Chapters 5, 6, 7, and 8. Chapters 1 to 4 can be considered as introductory. In response to popular demand, we have introduced a short treatise on semiconductor manufacturing in Chapter 2. Students with 4 prior introduction to semiconductor devices can traverse quickly .through Chapter 3. We urge everyone to do at least that, as a number of important notations and foundations are introduced in that chapter. In addition, an original approach to the modeling of deep-submicron transistors enabling manual analysis, is introduced. To emphasize the importance of interconnect in today's digital design, we have moved the modeling of interconnect forward in the text to Chapter 4. </p> <p> Chapters 9 to 12 are of a more advanced nature and can be used to provide a certain focus to the course. A course with a focus on the circuit aspects, for example, can supplement the core material with Chapters 9 and 12. A course focused on the digital system design should consider adding (parts of) Chapters 9, 10, and 11. All of these advanced chapters can be used to form the core of a graduate or a follow-on course. Sections considered advanced are marked with an asterisk in the text. </p> <p> A number of possible paths through the material for a senior-level class are enumerated below. In the <i>instructor documentation,</i> provided on the book's web site, we have included a number of complete syllabi based on courses run at some academic institutions. </p> <p> <i>Basic circuit class (with minor prior device knowledge):</i> <br> 1, 2.1-3, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, (9.1-9.3, 12). </p> <p> <i>Somewhat more advanced circuit coverage:</i> <br> 1, (2, 3), 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.1-10.3, 10.5-10.6, 12. </p> <p> <i>Course with systems focus:</i> <br> 1, (2, 3), 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.1-10.4, 11, 12.1-12.2. </p> <p> The <i>design methodology inserts</i> are, by preference, covered in concurrence with the chapter to which they are attached. </p> <p> In order to maintain a consistent flow through each of the chapters, the topics are <i>introduced</i> first, followed by a detailed and in-depth discussion of the ideas. A <i>Perspective</i> section discusses how the introduced concepts relate to real world designs and how they might be impacted by future evolutions. Each chapter finishes with a <i>Summary,</i> which briefly enumerates the topics covered in the text, followed by <i>To Probe Further and Reference</i> sections. These provide ample references and pointers for a reader interested in further details on some of the material. </p> <p> As the title of the book implies, one of the goals of this book is to stress the design aspect of digital circuits. To achieve this more practical viewpoint and to provide a real perspective, we have interspersed actual <i>design examples</i> and layouts throughout the text. These case studies help to answer questions, such as "How much area or speed or power is really saved by applying this technique?" To mimic the real design process, we are making extensive use of design tools such as circuit- and switch-level simulation as well as layout editing and extraction. Computer analysis is used throughout to verify manual results, to illustrate new concepts, or to examine complex behavior beyond the reach of manual analysis. </p> <p> Finally, to facilitate the learning process, there are numerous examples included in the text. Each chapter contains a number of <i>problems or brain-teasers</i> (answers for which can be found in the back of the book), that provoke thinking and understanding while reading. </p> <p><b>The Worldwide Web Companion</b></p> <p> A worldwide web companion ( <b>http://bwrc.eecs.berkeley.edu/IcBook/index.htm</b> ) provides fully worked-out design problems and a complete set of overhead transparencies, extracting the most important figures and graphs from the text. </p> <p> In contrast to the first edition, we have chosen <b>NOT to include problems sets</b> and <b>design problems</b> in the text. Instead we decided to make them available <b>on the book's web site.</b> This gives us the opportunity to dynamically upgrade and extend the problems, providing a more effective tool for the instructor. More than 300 challenging <i>exercises</i> are currently provided. The goal is to provide the individual reader an independent gauge for his understanding of the material and to provide practice in the use of some of the design tools. Each problem is keyed to the text sections it refers to (e.g., &lt;1.3&gt;), the design tools that must be used when solving the problem (e.g., SPICE) and a rating, ranking the problems on difficulty: (E) easy, (M) moderate, and (C) challenging. Problems marked with a (D) include a design or research elements. Solutions to the problem sets are available only to instructors of academic institutions that have chosen to adopt our book for classroom use. They are available through the publisher on a password-protected web site. </p> <p> Open-ended <i>design problems</i> help to gain the all-important insight into design optimization and trade-off. The use of design editing, verification and analysis tools is recommended when attempting these design problems. Fully worked out versions of these problems can be found on the web site. </p> <p> In addition, the book's web site also offers samples of hardware and software laboratories, extra background information, and useful links. </p> <p><b>Compelling Features of the Book</b></p> <ul> <li>Brings both circuit and systems views on design together.

Starting from a model of the semiconductor devices, we will gradually progress upwards, covering the inverter, the complex logic gate (NAND, NOR, XOR), the functional (adder, multiplier, shifter, register) and the system module (datapath, controller, memory) levels of abstraction. For each of these layers, the dominant design parameters are identified and simplified models are constructed, abstracting away the nonessential details. While this layered modeling approach is the designer's best handle on complexity, it has some pitfalls. This is illustrated in Chapters 9 and 10, where topics with a global impact, such as interconnect parasitics and chip timing, are discussed. To further express the dichotomy between circuit and system design visions, we have divided the book contents into two major parts: Part II (Chapters 4-7) addresses mostly the circuit perspective of digital circuit design, while Part III (Chapters 8-12) presents a more system oriented vision. Part I (Chapters 1-4) provides the necessary foundation (design metrics, the manufacturing process, device and interconnect models). </p> <p> <b>Chapter 1</b> serves as a global introduction. After a historical overview of digital circuit design, the concepts of hierarchical design and the different abstraction layers are introduced. A number of fundamental metrics, which help to quantify cost, reliability, and performance of a design, are introduced. </p> <p> <b>Chapter 2</b> provides a short and compact introduction to the <i>MOS manufacturing process.</i> Understanding the basic steps in the process helps to create the three-dimensional understanding of the MOS transistor, which is crucial when identifying the sources of the device parasitics. Many of the variations in device parameters can also be attributed to the manufacturing process as well. The chapter further introduces the concept of design rules, which form the interface between the designer and the manufacturer. The chapter concludes with an overview of the chip packaging process, an often-overlooked but crucial element of the digital IC design cycle. </p> <p> <b>Chapter 3</b> contains a summary of the primary design building blocks, <i>the semiconductor devices.</i> The main goal of this chapter is to provide an intuitive understanding of the operation of the MOS as well as to introduce the device models, which are used extensively in the later chapters. Major attention is paid to the artifacts of modern submicron devices, and the modeling thereof. Readers with prior device knowledge can traverse this material rather quickly. </p> <p> <b>Chapter 4</b> contains a careful analysis of the <i>wire,</i> with interconnect and its accompanying parasitics playing a major role. We visit each of the parasitics that come with a wire (capacitance, resistance, and inductance) in turn. Models for both manual and computer analysis are introduced. </p> <p> <b>Chapter 5</b> deals with the nucleus of digital design, <i>the inverter.</i> First, a number of fundamental properties of digital gates are introduced. These parameters, which help to quantify the performance and reliability of a gate, are derived in detail for two representative inverter structures: the static complementary CMOS. The techniques and approaches introduced in this chapter are of crucial importance, as they are repeated over and over again in the analysis of other gate structures and more complex gate stru...</p></p><h2>Applied Cryptography: Protocols, Algorithms, and Source Code in C</h2><p>". . .the best introduction to cryptography I've ever seen. . . .The book the National Security Agency wanted never to be published. . . ." -Wired Magazine<br> <br> ". . .monumental . . . fascinating . . . comprehensive . . . the definitive work on cryptography for computer programmers . . ." -Dr. Dobb's Journal<br> <br> ". . .easily ranks as one of the most authoritative in its field." -PC Magazine<br> <br> ". . .the bible of code hackers." -The Millennium Whole Earth Catalog<br> <br> This new edition of the cryptography classic provides you with a comprehensive survey of modern cryptography.

It covers the entire conceptual process, from developing smart strategy to executing it with strong ads&#x2015;from what to say to how to say it.&nbsp; <p>Part 1, <em>Strategies</em>, operates on the premise that the idea beneath an ad&#x2019;s surface determines its success. This first section shows how to research products, understand consumer behavior, analyze audiences, and navigate marketplace realities, then how to write creative briefs that focus this strategic analysis into specific advertising objectives. Part 2, <em>Executions</em>, explains how to put strategy into play. It discusses the tools at a copywriter&#x2019;s command&#x2015;creating a distinctive brand voice, telling stories, using language powerfully and originally&#x2015;as well as the wide variety of media and advertising genres that carry and help shape messages. But great executions are elusive. So Part 3, the <em>Toolbox</em>, gives advice about how to think creatively, then presents an array of problem-solving tools, a series of techniques that advertisers have used repeatedly to produce exceptional work.&nbsp;</p><p>In brief, this book shows how to find strong selling ideas and how to express them in fresh, memorable, persuasive ways. The new edition features greatly expanded discussions of guerrilla advertising, interactive advertising, brand voice, storytelling, and the use of social media. Hundreds of ads in full color, both in the book and on an accompanying Web site, demonstrate the best in television, radio, print, and interactive advertising. <em>Advertising: Concept and Copy</em> is the most comprehensive text in its field, combining substantial discussion of both strategy and technique with an emphasis on the craft of writing not found elsewhere.

Much of what makes civilization had already existed for thousands of years in Egypt and in Mesopotamia, and had spread thence to neighbouring countries. But certain elements had been lacking until the Greeks supplied them. What they achieved in art and literature is familiar to everybody, but what they did in the purely intellectual realm is even more exceptional. They invented mathematics and science and philosophy; they first wrote history as opposed to mere annals; they speculated freely about the nature of the world and the ends of life, without being bound in the fetters of any inherited orthodoxy. What occurred was so astonishing that, until very recent times, men were content to gape and talk mystically about the Greek genius. It is possible, however, to understand the development of Greece in scientific terms, and it is well worth while to do so.<br><br>Philosophy begins with Thales, who, fortunately, can be dated by the fact that he predicted an eclipse which, according to the astronomers, occurred in the year 585 B.C. Philosophy and science -- which were not originally separate -- were therefore born together at the beginning of the sixth century. What had been happening in Greece and neighbouring countries before this time? Any answer must be in part conjectural, but archeology, during the present century, has given us much more knowledge than was possessed by our grandfathers.<br><br>The art of writing was invented in Egypt about the year 4000 B.C., and in Babylonia not much later. In each country writing began with pictures of the objects intended. These pictures quickly became conventionalized, so that words were represented by ideograms, as they still are in China. In the course of thousands of years, this cumbrous system developed into alphabetic writing.<br><br>The early development of civilization in Egypt and Mesopotamia was due to the Nile, the Tigris, and the Euphrates, which made agriculture very easy and very productive. The civilization was in many ways similar to that which the Spaniards found in Mexico and Peru. There was a divine king, with despotic powers; in Egypt, he owned all the land. There was a polytheistic religion, with a supreme god to whom the king had a specially intimate relation. There was a military aristocracy, and also a priestly aristocracy. The latter was often able to encroach on the royal power, if the king was weak or if he was engaged in a difficult war. The cultivators of the soil were serfs, belonging to the king, the aristocracy, or the priesthood.<br><br>There was a considerable difference between Egyptian and Babylonian theology. The Egyptians were preoccupied with death, and believed that the souls of the dead descend into the underworld, where they are judged by Osiris according to the manner of their life on earth. They thought that the soul would ultimately return to the body; this led to mummification and to the construction of splendid tombs. The pyramids were built by various kings at the end of the fourth millennium B.C. and the beginning of the third. After this time, Egyptian civilization became more and more stereotyped, and religious conservatism made progress impossible. About 1800 B.C. Egypt was conquered by Semites named Hyksos, who ruled the country for about two centuries. They left no permanent mark on Egypt, but their presence there must have helped to spread Egyptian civilization in Syria and Palestine.<br><br>Babylonia had a more warlike development than Egypt. At first, the ruling race were not Semites, but "Sumerians," whose origin is unknown. They invented cuneiform writing, which the conquering Semites took over from them. There was a period when there were various independent cities which fought with each other, but in the end Babylon became supreme and established an empire. The gods of other cities became subordinate, and Marduk, the god of Babylon, acquired a position like that later held by Zeus in the Greek pantheon. The same sort of thing had happened in Egypt, but at a much earlier time.<br><br>The religions of Egypt and Babylonia, like other ancient religions, were originally fertility cults. The earth was female, the sun male. The bull was usually regarded as an embodiment of male fertility, and bull-gods were common. In Babylon, Ishtar, the earth-goddess, was supreme among female divinities. Throughout western Asia, the Great Mother was worshipped under various names. When Greek colonists in Asia Minor found temples to her, they named her Artemis and took over the existing cult. This is the origin of "Diana of the Ephesians." Christianity transformed her into the Virgin Mary, and it was a Council at Ephesus that legitimated the title "Mother of God" as applied to Our Lady.<br><br>Where a religion was bound up with the government of an empire, political motives did much to transform its primitive features. A god or goddess became associated with the State, and had to give, not only an abundant harvest, but victory in war. A rich priestly caste elaborated the ritual and the theology, and fitted together into a pantheon the several divinities of the component parts of the empire.<br><br>Through association with government, the gods also became associated with morality. Lawgivers received their codes from a god; thus a breach of the law became an impiety. The oldest legal code still known is that of Hammurabi, king of Babylon, about 2100 B.C.; this code was asserted by the king to have been delivered to him by Marduk. The connection between religion and morality became continually closer throughout ancient times.<br><br>Babylonian religion, unlike that of Egypt, was more concerned with prosperity in this world than with happiness in the next. Magic, divination, and astrology, though not peculiar to Babylonia, were more developed there than elsewhere, and it was chiefly through Babylon that they acquired their hold on later antiquity. From Babylon come some things that belong to science: the division of the day into twenty-four hours, and of the circle into 360 degrees; also the discovery of a cycle in eclipses, which enabled lunar eclipses to be predicted with certainty, and solar eclipses with some probability. This Babylonian knowledge, as we shall see, was acquired by Thales.<br><br>The civilizations of Egypt and Mesopotamia were agricultural, and those of surrounding nations, at first, were pastoral. A new element came with the development of commerce, which was at first almost entirely maritime. Weapons, until about 1000 B.C., were made of bronze, and nations which did not have the necessary metals on their own territory were obliged to obtain them by trade or piracy. Piracy was a temporary expedient, and where social and political conditions were fairly stable, commerce was found to be more profitable. In commerce, the island of Crete seems to have been the pioneer. For about eleven centuries, say from 2500 B.C. to 1400 B.C., an artistically advanced culture, called the Minoan, existed in Crete. What survives of Cretan art gives an impression of cheerfulness and almost decadent luxury, very different from the terrifying gloom of Egyptian temples.<br><br>Of this important civilization almost nothing was known until the excavations of Sir Arthur Evans and others. It was a maritime civilization, in close touch with Egypt (except during the time of the Hyksos). From Egyptian pictures it is evident that the very considerable commerce between Egypt and Crete was carried on by Cretan sailors; this commerce reached its maximum about 1500 B.C. The Cretan religion appears to have had many affinities with the religions of Syria and Asia Minor, but in art there was more affinity with Egypt, though Cretan art was very original and amazingly full of life. The centre of the Cretan civilization was the so-called "palace of Minos" at Knossos, of which memories lingered in the traditions of classical Greece. The palaces of Crete were very magnificent, but were destroyed about the end of the fourteenth century B.C., probably by invaders from Greece. The chronology of Cretan history is derived from Egyptian objects found in Crete, and Cretan objects found in Egypt; throughout, our knowledge is dependent on archeological evidence.<br><br>The Cretans worshipped a goddess, or perhaps several goddesses. The most indubitable goddess was the "Mistress of Animals," who was a huntress, and probably the source of the classical Artemis. She or another was also a mother; the only male deity, apart from the "Master of Animals," is her young son. There is some evidence of belief in an after life, in which, as in Egyptian belief, deeds on earth receive reward or retribution. But on the whole the Cretans appear, from their art, to have been cheerful people, not much oppressed by gloomy superstitions. They were fond of bull-fights, at which female as well as male toreadors performed amazing acrobatic feats. The bull-fights were religious celebrations, and Sir Arthur Evans thinks that the performers belonged to the highest nobility. The surviving pictures are full of movement and realism.<br><br>The Cretans had a linear script, but it has not been deciphered. At home they were peaceful, and their cities were unwalled; no doubt they were defended by sea power.<br><br>Before the destruction of the Minoan culture, it spread, about 1600 B.C., to the mainland of Greece, where it survived, through gradual stages of degeneration, until about 900 B.C. This mainland civilization is called the Mycenaean; it is known through the tombs of kings, and also through fortresses on hill- tops, which show more fear of war than had existed in Crete. Both tombs and fortresses remained to impress the imagination of classical Greece. The older art products in the palaces are either actually of Cretan workmanship, or closely akin to those of Crete. The Mycenaean civilization, seen through a haze of legend, is that which is depicted in Homer.<br><br>There is much uncertainty concerning the Mycenaeans. Did they owe their civilization to being conquered by the Cretans? Did they speak Greek, or were they an earlier indigenous race? No certain answer to these questions is possible, but on the whole it seems probable that they were conquerors who spoke Greek, and that at least the aristocracy consisted of fair-haired invaders from the North, who brought the Greek language with them. The Greeks came to Greece in three successive waves, first the Ionians, then the Achaeans, and last the Dorians. The Ionians appear, though conquerors, to have adopted the Cretan civilization pretty completely, as, later, the Romans adopted the civilization of Greece. But the Ionians were disturbed, and largely dispossessed, by their successors the Achaeans. The Achaeans are known, from the Hittite tablets found at Boghaz-Keul, to have had a large organized empire in the fourteenth century B.C. The Mycenaean civilization, which had been weakened by the warfare of the Ionians and Achaeans, was practically destroyed by the Dorians, the last Greek invaders. Whereas previous invaders had largely adopted the Minoan religion, the Dorians retained the original Indo-European religion of their ancestors. The religion of Mycenaean times, however, lingered on, especially in the lower classes, and the religion of classical Greece was a blend of the two.<br><br>Although the above account seems probable, it must be remembered that we do not <i>know</i> whether the Mycenaeans were Greeks or not. What we do know is that their civilization decayed, that about the time when it ended iron superseded bronze, and that for some time sea supremacy passed to the Phoenicians.<br><br>Both during the later part of the Mycenaean age and after its end, some of the invaders settled down and became agriculturists, while some pushed on, first into the islands and Asia Minor, then into Sicily and southern Italy, where they founded cities that lived by maritime commerce. It was in these maritime cities that the Greeks first made qualitatively new contributions to civilization; the supremacy of Athens came later, and was equally associated, when it came, with naval power.<br><br>The mainland of Greece is mountainous and largely infertile. But there are many fertile valleys, with easy access to the sea, but cut off by the mountains from easy land communication with each other. In these valleys little separate communities grew up, living by agriculture, and centering round a town, generally close to the sea. In such circumstances it was natural that, as soon as the population of any community grew too great for its internal resources, those who could not live on the land should take to seafaring. The cities of the mainland founded colonies, often in places where it was much easier to find subsistence than it had been at home. Thus in the earliest historical period the Greeks of Asia Minor, Sicily, and Italy were much richer than those of the Greek mainland.<br><br>The social system was very different in different parts of Greece. In Sparta, a small aristocracy subsisted on the labour of oppressed serfs of a different race; in the poorer agricultural regions, the population consisted mainly of farmers cultivating their own land with the help of their families. But where commerce and industry flourished, the free citizens grew rich by the employment of slaves -- male in the mines, female in the textile industry. These slaves were, in Ionia, of the surrounding barbarian population, and were, as a rule, first acquired in war. With increasing wealth went increasing isolation of respectable women, who in later times had little part in the civilized aspects of Greek life except in Sparta.<br><br>There was a very general development, first from monarchy to aristocracy, then to an alternation of tyranny and democracy. The kings were not absolute, like those of Egypt and Babylonia; they were advised by a Council of Elders, and could not transgress custom with impunity. "Tyranny" did not mean necessarily bad government, but only the rule of a man whose claim to power was not hereditary. "Democracy" meant government by all the citizens, among whom slaves and women were not included. The early tyrants, like the Medici, acquired their power through being the richest members of their respective plutocracies. Often the source of their wealth was the ownership of gold and silver mines, made the more profitable by the new institution of coinage, which came from the kingdom of Lydia, adjacent to Ionia. Coinage seems to have been invented shortly before 700 B.C.<br><br>One of the most important results, to the Greeks, of commerce or piracy -- at first the two are scarcely distinct -- was the acquisition of the art of writing. Although writing had existed for thousands of years in Egypt and Babylonia, and the Minoan Cretans had a script (which has not been deciphered), there is no conclusive evidence that the Greeks knew how to write until about the tenth century B.C. They learnt the art from the Phoenicians, who, like the other inhabitants of Syria, were exposed to both Egyptian and Babylonian influences, and who held the supremacy in maritime commerce until the rise of the Greek cities of Ionia, Italy, and Sicily. In the fourteenth century, writing to Ikhnaton (the heretic king of Egypt), Syrians still used the Babylonian cuneiform; but Hiram of Tyre (969-936) used the Phoenician alphabet, which probably developed out of the Egyptian script. The Egyptians used, at first, a pure picture writing; gradually the pictures, much conventionalized, came to represent syllables (the first syllables of the names of the things pictured), and at last single letters, on the principle of "A was an Archer who shot at a frog."

Physics is a description of reality, and thus each topic begins with concrete observations and experiences that readers can directly relate to. We then move on to the generalizations and more formal treatment of the topic. Not only does this make the material more interesting and easier to understand, but it is closer to the way physics is actually practiced. Key Topics: ELECTRIC CHARGE AND ELECTRIC FIELD, GAUSS&#39;S LAW, ELECTRIC POTENTIAL, CAPACITANCE, DIELECTRICS, ELECTRIC ENERGY STORAGE, ELECTRIC CURRENTS AND RESISTANCE, DC CIRCUITS, MAGNETISM, SOURCES OF MAGNETIC FIELD, ELECTROMAGNETIC INDUCTION AND FARADAY&#39;S LAW, INDUCTANCE, ELECTROMAGNETIC OSCILLATIONS, AND AC CIRCUITS, MAXWELL&#39;S EQUATIONS AND ELECTROMAGNETIC WAVES, LIGHT: REFLECTION AND REFRACTION, LENSES AND OPTICAL INSTRUMENTS, THE WAVE NATURE OF LIGHT; INTERFERENCE, DIFFRACTION AND POLARIZATION, Market Description: This book is written for readers interested in learning the basics of physics.<p> <b>Douglas C.

This beautiful book surveys the architecture and arts of the traditional Islamic lands during this era.<br><br>Conceived as a sequel to <i>The Art and Architecture of Islam: 650-1250</i>, by Richard Ettinghausen and Oleg Grabar, the book follows the general format of the first volume, with chronological and regional divisions and architecture treated separately from the other arts. The authors describe over two hundred works of Islamic art of this period and also investigate broader social and economic contexts, considering such topics as function, patronage, and meaning. They discuss, for example, how the universal caliphs of the first six centuries gave way to regional rulers and how, in this new world order, Iranian forms, techniques, and motifs played a dominant role in the artistic life of most of the Muslim world; the one exception was the Maghrib, an area protected from the full brunt of the Mongol invasions, where traditional models continued to inspire artists and patrons. By the sixteenth century, say the authors, the eastern Mediterranean under the Ottomans and the area of northern India under the Mughals had become more powerful, and the Iranian models of early Ottoman and Mughal art gradually gave way to distinct regional and imperial styles. The authors conclude with a provocative essay on the varied legacies of Islamic art in Europe and the Islamic lands in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.</p><p><b>Sheila S. Blair</b> and <b>Jonathan M. Bloom</b> are area editors of Islam for <i>The Dictionary of Art</i>.Intended as a standard text, this volume by the area editors of Islam for The Dictionary of Art (1980. 3d ed.) is a sequel to Richard Ettinghausen and Oleg Grabar's now classic The Art and Architecture of Islam: 650-1250 (Viking, 1988). Organized simply by chronology (with sections on 1250-1500 and 1500-1800) and then by geography (Iran and Central Asia, the Middle East and North Africa, Asia Minor, and India), the text focuses separately on architecture and "the arts." Each chapter concentrates on a limited number of significant objects, discussing not only stylistic and aesthetic issues but also addressing the social, historical, and economic contexts of those works. Although this book is densely written in a manner typical of survey texts and lacking the richly colored glossy reproductions of a coffee-table tome, its comprehensive coverage entitles it to become part of any library with the slightest interest in art.<br><i>Eugene C.

Rothko also wrote a number of essays and critical reviews during his lifetime, adding his thoughtful, intelligent, and opinionated voice to the debates of the contemporary art world. Although the artist never published a book of his varied and complex views, his heirs indicate that he occasionally spoke of the existence of such a manuscript to friends and colleagues. Stored in a New York City warehouse since the artist&#x2019;s death more than thirty years ago, this extraordinary manuscript, titled <i>The Artist&#x2019;s Reality, </i>is now being published for the first time.<br><br> Probably written around 1940&#x2013;41, this revelatory book discusses Rothko&#x2019;s ideas on the modern art world, art history, myth, beauty, the challenges of being an artist in society, the true nature of &#x201c;American art,&#x201d; and much more. <i>The Artist&#x2019;s Reality</i> also<i></i>includes an introduction by Christopher Rothko, the artist&#x2019;s son, who describes the discovery of the manuscript and the complicated and fascinating process of bringing the manuscript to publication. The introduction is illustrated with a small selection of relevant examples of the artist&#x2019;s own work as well as with reproductions of pages from the actual manuscript.<br><br><i>The Artist&#x2019;s Reality </i>will<i></i>be a classic text for years to come, offering insight into both the work and the artistic philosophies of this great painter.</p></p><p>Mark Rothko, the painter famous for his luminous abstract canvases, spent several years in the late 1930s and early '40s writing a book about the meaning of art. Edited by his son Christopher, Rothko's uncompleted manuscript, <i>The Artist's Reality: Philosophies of Art</i>, reveals a man struggling to make a case for the highest ideals of Western culture at a time when crass popular taste and American regionalism were conspiring against the values he held dear. During these years, Rothko worked in a melancholy Expressionist style that was just beginning to be influenced by Surrealism. The hovering rectangles of color that would put him on the modern art map were still a decade away. While this book will no doubt be important to Rothko scholars, it is a period piece, relying on a form of rhetoric and a belief system that can be exasperating to modern readers. Windy chapters on such topics as "The Integrity of the Plastic Process," studded with references to Plato and Leonardo, "truth" and "unity," are Rothko's stock in trade. He never mentions his own paintings and refers to a few other living artists only in passing. And yet--as Christopher Rothko points out in his clear-eyed and useful introduction--the process of wrestling ideas onto the page may have helped the artist find a personal means of expressing the "tragic emotionality" that he believed to be the essence of all great art. Rothko longed to discover a new, post-Christian "myth" that could express a unified outlook on life by embodying "the world of ideals." Little did he realize at the time that the resolution of his dilemma would be based on a radically new approach to handling paint and using color. <i>&#x2014;Cathy Curtis</i><p><b>Mark Rothko</b> was born in Russia and came to the United States with his family in 1913.

Rupp accomplishes what few scholars have even attempted: she combines a vast array of scholarship on supposedly discrete episodes in American history into an entertaining and entirely readable story of same-sex desire across the country and the centuries.<br> <br> "Most extraordinary about Leila J. Rupp's indeed short, two-hundred-page history of 'same-sex love and sexuality' is not that it manages to account for such a variety of individuals, races, and classes or take in such a broad chronological and thematic range, but rather that it does all this with such verve, lucidity, and analytical rigor. . . . [A]n elegant, inspiring survey." &#x2014;John Howard, <i>Journal of American History</i><br></p></p><p>Although this new history of same-sex desire does not offer the long, satisfying narratives of Lillian Faderman's <i>Odd Girls and Twilight Lovers</i> or the sweep of David Greenberg's <i>The Construction of Homosexuality</i>, it does provide a solid introduction to the subject. Tantalizing fragments from the 17th and 18th centuries are joined with later evidence to flesh out Rupp's vision, which draws on Native American and African practices as well as the culture brought to (and imposed on) America by the Europeans. While surveying the more familiar history of gay culture in the cities, she also describes the growth of small, hidden lesbian and gay communities in places as unlikely as Salt Lake City, far removed from the urban centers of vice. Rupp also surveys changes in attitude toward same-sex love within academia in the last 50 years, as well as in American culture at large, and provides a useful bibliography. <i>--Regina Marler</i>With this book, Leila J.

Bernard Williams's original and radical book questions this picture of Western history. While we are in many ways different from the Greeks, Williams claims that the differences are not to be traced to a shift in these basic conceptions of ethical life. We are more like the ancients than we are prepared to acknowledge, and only when this is understood can we properly grasp our most important differences from them, such as our rejection of slavery.<br><br>The author is a philosopher, but much of his book is directed to writers such as Homer and the tragedians, whom he discusses as poets and not just as materials for philosophy. At the center of his study is the question of how we can understand Greek tragedy at all, when its world is so far from ours.<br><br>Williams explains how it is that when the ancients speak, they do not merely tell us about themselves, but about ourselves. <i>Shame and Necessity</i> gives a new account of our relations to the Greeks, and helps us to see what ethical ideas we need in order to live in the modern world.</p><p><b>Bernard Williams</b> (1929-2003) was White's Professor of Moral Philosophy at Oxford University, and Monroe Deutsch Professor of Philosophy at the University of California, Berkeley. His previous books include <i>Descartes: The Project of Pure Inquiry</i> (1979), <i>Moral Luck</i> (1981), and <i>Ethics and the Limits of Philosophy</i> (1985).This book is about ancient Greek ethical ideas, primarily of Homer and the tragedians. Denying that modern ethical understanding is merely a progressive version of Greek thought, Williams contends that the ancients' ideas can illuminate our own. His question is how to respond to a view grounded in supernatural conceptions we have long since discarded. He examines Greek ideas of agency, intention, practical deliberation, akrasia ("weakness of will"), necessity, and so forth, analyzing which motivations the Greeks found admirable and, especially, how shame, guilt, regret, and forgiveness interrelate. Significant contrasts concern whether the moral self is characterless, what warrants self-respect, and how to regard unintentionally caused suffering. Clearly written, well argued, and carefully documented, the book should interest classicists and philosophers alike.<br><i>- Robert Hoffman, York Coll., </i><br>Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Polyvagal Flip Chart: Understanding the Science of Safety (Norton Series on Interpersonal Neurobiology)</h2><p><p><strong>Offers therapists a low tech&#x2013;high impact, interactive way to explain polyvagal theory to clients.</strong></p><p>When clients are stuck in the cognitive experience of their story, an explanation of polyvagal theory helps to bring their attention to the autonomic experience&#x2015; to bring the importance of the biology of their experience back into awareness.

Selected and translated by Helen Waddell, <b>The Desert Fathers</b> opens a window onto early Christianity while presenting us with touchingly human models of faith, humility, and compassion. With a new Preface by the Cistercian monk, writer, and revered teacher of contemplative prayer M. Basil Pennington, author of <b>O Holy Mountain</b> and <b>Challenges in Prayer</b>.<br><br>"God is our home but many of us have strayed from our native land.&nbsp;&nbsp;The venerable authors of these Spiritual Classics are expert guides--may we follow their directions home."<br>--Archbishop Desmond Tutu</p><p><i>The Desert Fathers</i> is a handy introduction to the sayings and stories of the earliest contemplatives--the men and women who, in the fourth century, escaped towns and cities to seek God and wrestle with demons in the deserts of Africa and Asia Minor. Some of these stories (such as the life of St. Anthony, the first monk) read almost like sci-fi, with their exuberant miracles exploding in exotic locations. All of them help readers understand the value and danger of liberating oneself from the constrictions of society. <i>--Michael Joseph Gross</i><b>Helen Waddell </b>(1889&#x2013;1965), author and translator, was born in Tokyo and educated at Victoria College and Queen's University, Belfast, and at Somerville College, Oxford.

But according to naturalist Candace Savage, bird brain,&#x201d; as a pejorative expression, should be rendered obsolete by new research on the family of corvids: crows and their close relations.<br>The ancients who regarded these remarkable birds as oracles, bringers of wisdom, or agents of vengeance were on the right track, for corvids appear to have powers of abstraction, memory, and creativity that put them on a par with many mammals, even higher primates. <i>Bird Brains</i> presents these bright, brassy, and surprisingly colorful birds in a remarkable collection of full-color, close-up photographs by some two dozen of the world&#x2019;s best wildlife photographers.<br> Savage&#x2019;s lively, authoritative text describes the life and behavior of sixteen representative corvid species that inhabit North America and Europe. Drawing on recent research, she describes birds that recognize each other as individuals, call one another by name,&#x201d; remember and relocate thousands of hidden food caches, engage in true teamwork and purposeful play, and generally exhibit an extraordinary degree of sophistication.</p><p>back! Examines the lives and behaviors of the highly intelligent members of the crow family, corvids, and includes 61 dramatic images from the world&#39;s top nature photographers.Candace Savage is the author of numerous internationally acclaimed books of natural history, including The World of the Wolf, Wild Cats (Sierra Club, 1994) and Aurora: The Mysterious Northern Lights.</p><h2>NightWatch: A Practical Guide to Viewing the Universe</h2><p><p> With 250,000 copies in print since its initial publication in 1983, <b>NightWatch</b> has become a standard reference guide for stargazers throughout North America. </p><p> The new Third Edition expands on that success with a completely revised and updated text, more than 100 new color photos and diagrams and 16 additional pages that cover such! new astronomical pursuits as computerized telescopes, reviews of new telescope designs and accessories, and astronomy on the Internet. </p><p> All charts, tables and diagrams have been updated and, in some cases, redesigned for easier use. Improved spacecraft measurements of the distances to the stars (recently released by the European Space Agency) are included in the charts, along with additional observing tips for stargazers using binoculars and telescopes. An expanded chapter on Astrophotography lists the best modern films and cameras for skyshooting. </p><p> The new <b>NightWatch</b> is faithful to the "ultra-simplified, no jargon" philosophy of the original, and at the same time, offers substantially more practical information for the novice and intermediate-level amateur astronomer. The Royal Astronomical Society of Canada called the first edition "the best of its kind"- the new Third Edition is better still. It is still an abundantly illustrated, wide-sized volume designed for easy reference during many starlit nights. </p></p><p>The third edition of <i>Nightwatch</i> continues its tradition of being the best handbook for the beginning astronomer. Terence Dickinson covers <i>all</i> the problems beginners face, starting with the fact that the night sky does not look the way a modern city-dweller expects. He discusses light pollution, how to choose binoculars and telescopes, how to pronounce the names of stars and constellations, telescope mounts, averted vision, and why the harvest moon looks especially bright. Most of the lovely photographs in the book were taken by amateurs, which gives the section on astrophotography a particularly inspirational gleam.<p> Dickinson's star charts are very handy, each covering a reasonable field of view and mapping the most interesting amateur objects. He gives good advice for planet watching, which he notes "is one of the few astronomical activities that can be conducted almost as well from the city as from dark rural locations."</p><p> Altogether, the watchword for <i>Nightwatch</i> is indeed "practical"--this is a book to be used, not just read. Spiral-bound to lie flat or to fold back undamaged, it's a field guide that pulls its own weight in the field. Author Timothy Ferris says, "Like a good night sky, <i>Nightwatch</i> is clear and wind-free. Try it and see for yourself." <i>--Mary Ellen Curtin</i></p><p> <b>Terence Dickinson</b> is a prolific science writer specializing in astronomy.

The exposition is divided into three parts: 1) representation formulas for solutions, 2) theory for linear partial differential equations, and 3) theory for nonlinear partial differential equations. <p>Included are complete treatments of the method of characteristics; energy methods within Sobolev spaces; regularity for second-order elliptic, parabolic, and hyperbolic equations; maximum principles; the multidimensional calculus of variations; viscosity solutions of Hamilton-Jacobi equations; shock waves and entropy criteria for conservation laws; and much more. </p><p>The author summarizes the relevant mathematics required to understand current research in PDEs, especially nonlinear PDEs. While he has reworked and simplified much of the classical theory (particularly the method of characteristics), he emphasizes the modern interplay between functional analytic insights and calculus-type estimates within the context of Sobolev spaces. Treatment of all topics is complete and self-contained. The book's wide scope and clear exposition make it a suitable text for a graduate course in PDEs.</p></p><p>"...Highly recommend the book for students as well as for lectures in PDE." -- <i>Monatshefte fur Mathematik</i><br><br>"...entirely possible that the ...text could eventually become the benchmark. ...extremely well written..." -- <i>SIAM Review</i><br><br>"For a student wishing to specialise in the theory of PDEs it provides a very solid foundation." -- <i>The Mathematical Gazette</i><br><br>"Highly recommend the book for students as well as for lectures in PDE." -- <i>Monatshefte fr Mathematik</i><br><br>"It is a standard treatment with good notation.

So begins this most beloved of all American Zen books. Seldom has such a small handful of words provided a teaching as rich as has this famous opening line of Shunryu Suzuki's classic. In a single stroke, the simple sentence cuts through the pervasive tendency students have of getting so close to Zen as to completely miss what it's all about. An instant teaching on the first page. And that's just the beginning. <br><br> In the thirty years since its original publication, <i>Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind </i>has become one of the great modern Zen classics, much beloved, much re-read, and much recommended as the best first book to read on Zen. Suzuki Roshi presents the basics&#x2014;from the details of posture and breathing in <i>zazen</i> to the perception of nonduality&#x2014;in a way that is not only remarkably clear, but that also resonates with the joy of insight from the first to the last page. It's a book to come back to time and time again as an inspiration to practice.</p><p>Shunryu Suzuki (1904&#x2013;1971) was one of the most influential spiritual teachers of the twentieth century and is truly a founding father of Zen in America. A Japanese priest of the Soto lineage, he taught in the United States from 1959 until his death. He was the founder of the San Francisco Zen Center and the Tassajara Zen Mountain Center. He is the author of <i>Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind</i> and <i>Branching Streams Flow in the Darkness: Zen Talks on the Sandokai</i>, and he is the subject of the biography <i>Crooked Cucumber </i> by David Chadwick.&#x201c;One of the best and most succinct introductions to Zen practice.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>Library Journal</i> <br><br>"This is one of the top five Buddhist books, ever."&#x2014;<i>Elephant</i></p><h2>The Bondwoman&#39;s Narrative</h2><p>Tells the story of Hannah Crafts, a young slave working on a wealthy North Carolina plantation, who runs away in a bid for freedom up North.</p><p>Few events are more thrilling than the discovery of a buried treasure. Some years ago, when scholar Henry Louis Gates Jr. was leafing through an auction catalog, he noticed a listing for an unpublished, clothbound manuscript thought to date from the 1850s: "<i>The Bondwoman's Narrative</i>, by Hannah Crafts, a Fugitive Slave, Recently Escaped from North Carolina." Gates realized that, if genuine, this would be the first novel known to have been written by a black woman in America, as well as the only one by a fugitive slave. He bought the manuscript (there was no competing bid) and began the exhilarating task of confirming the racial identity of the author and the approximate date of composition (circa 1855-59). Gates's excited descriptions of his detective work in the introduction to <i>The Bondwoman's Narrative</i> will make you want to find promising old manuscripts of your own. He also proposes a couple candidates for authorship, assuming that Hannah Crafts was the real or assumed name of the author, and not solely a pen name.<p> If Gates is right (his introduction and appendix should convince just about everyone), <i>The Bondwoman's Narrative</i> is a tremendous discovery. But is it a lost masterpiece? No. The novel draws so heavily on the conventions of mid-19th-century fiction--by turns religious, gothic, and sentimental--that it does not have much flavor of its own. The beginning of chapter 13 is a close paraphrase (virtually a cribbing) of the opening of Dickens's <i>Bleak House</i>. This borrowing seems to have escaped Gates, although he does quote the assessment of one scholar, the librarian Dorothy Porter Wesley, who had owned the manuscript before he acquired it, that "the best of the writer's mind was religious and emotional and in her handling of plot the long arm of coincidence is nowhere spared." Although not a striking literary contribution, <i>The Bondwoman's Narrative</i> is well worth reading on historical grounds, especially since it was never published. As Gates argues, these pages provide our first "unedited, unaffected, unglossed, unaided" glimpse into the mind of a fugitive slave. <i>--Regina Marler</i></p>Henry Louis Gates, Jr., is a regular contributor to the New Yorker.

In addition, he presents a critique of the idea of immutability and the concept of nothingness, from Plato and Aristotle through the evolutionism of his contemporaries.<br>Bergson's influence on Marcel Proust and other twentieth-century writers renders a grasp of his theories imperative to students of literature as well as philosophy. Historians of science and other readers will also appreciate the importance of this milestone in philosophical and evolutionary thought.</p><p>Anticipating not only modern scientific theories of psychology but also those of cosmology, this astonishing book sets out a impressive goal for itself: to reconcile human biology with a theory of consciousness. First published in France in 1907, and translated into English in 1911, this work of wonder was esteemed at the time in scientific circles and in the popular culture alike for its profound explorations of perception and memory and its surprising conclusions about the nature and value of art. <p> Contending that intuition is deeper than intellect and that the real consequence of evolution is a mental freedom to grow, to change, to seek and create novelty, Bergson reinvigorated the theory of evolution by refusing to see it as merely mechanistic. His expansion on Darwin remains one of the most original and important philosophical arguments for a scientific inquiry still under fire today.</p>Bergson won the Nobel Prize in literature in 1927.</p><h2>Rob Roy (Wordsworth Classics)</h2><p>From its first publication in 1816 Rob Roy has been recognised as containing some of Scott s finest writing and most engaging, fully realised characters. The outlaw Rob Roy MacGregor was already a legendary, disputed figure by the time Scott wrote a heroic Scottish Robin Hood to some, an over-glamorised, unprincipled predator to others. Scott approaches Rob Roy indirectly, through the adventures of his fictional hero, Frank Osbaldistone, amid the political turmoil of England and Scotland in 1715. With characteristic care Scott reconstructs the period and settings so as to place Rob Roy and the Scotland he inhabits amid conflicting moral, economic and historical forces. This edition features, besides a new critical introduction and extensive explanatory notes, an essay outlining clearly the novels historical context and a glossary of Scottish words and phrases used by Scotts colourful, vernacular characters.</p><p>This novel, first published in 1817, achieved a huge success and helped establish the historical novel as a literary form. In rich prose and vivid description, <b>Rob Roy</b> follows the adventures of a businessman's son, Frank Osbaldistone, who is sent to Scotland and finds himself drawn to the powerful, enigmatic figure of Rob Roy MacGregor, the romantic outlaw who fights for justice and dignity for the Scots. This is an incomparable portrait of the haunted Highlands and Scotland's glorious past.Founded in 1906 by J.M.

Unique editorial features that help Everyman Paperback Classics stand out from the crowd include: a leading scholar or literary critic&#39;s introduction to the text, a biography of the author, a chronology of her or his life and times, a historical selection of criticism, and a concise plot summary. All books published since 1993 have also been completely restyled: all type has been reset, to offer a clarity and ease of reading unique among editions of the classics; a vibrant, full-color cover design now complements these great texts with beautiful contemporary works of art. But the best feature must be Everyman&#39;s uniquely low price. Each Everyman title offers these extensive materials at a price that competes with the most inexpensive editions on the market-but Everyman Paperbacks have durable binding, quality paper, and the highest editorial and scholarly standards.</p><h2>GO! with Microsoft Word 2016 Comprehensive (GO! for Office 2016 Series)</h2><p><p> <b>Teach the course YOU want in LESS TIME!</b> </p> <p>In today's fast-moving, mobile environment, the <b> <i>GO! with Office 2016</i> </b> series focuses on the job skills needed to succeed in the workforce.

Why did the Industrial Revolution--and the unprecedented economic growth that came with it--occur in eighteenth-century England, and not at some other time, or in some other place? Why didn't industrialization make the whole world rich--and why did it make large parts of the world even poorer? In <i>A Farewell to Alms</i>, Gregory Clark tackles these profound questions and suggests a new and provocative way in which culture--not exploitation, geography, or resources--explains the wealth, and the poverty, of nations.</p><br><p> Countering the prevailing theory that the Industrial Revolution was sparked by the sudden development of stable political, legal, and economic institutions in seventeenth-century Europe, Clark shows that such institutions existed long before industrialization. He argues instead that these institutions gradually led to deep cultural changes by encouraging people to abandon hunter-gatherer instincts-violence, impatience, and economy of effort-and adopt economic habits-hard work, rationality, and education.</p><br><p> The problem, Clark says, is that only societies that have long histories of settlement and security seem to develop the cultural characteristics and effective workforces that enable economic growth. For the many societies that have not enjoyed long periods of stability, industrialization has not been a blessing. Clark also dissects the notion, championed by Jared Diamond in <i>Guns, Germs, and Steel</i>, that natural endowments such as geography account for differences in the wealth of nations.</p><br><p> A brilliant and sobering challenge to the idea that poor societies can be economically developed through outside intervention, <i>A Farewell to Alms</i> may change the way global economic history is understood.</p></p><p><p>"What caused the Industrial Revolution? Gregory Clark has a brilliant and fascinating explanation for this event which permanently changed the life of humankind after 100,000 years of stagnation."--<b>George Akerlof, Nobel Laureate in Economics and Koshland Professor of Economics, University of California, Berkeley</b></p><p>"This is a very important book. Gregory Clark argues that the Industrial Revolution was the gradual but inevitable result of a kind of natural selection during the harsh struggle for existence in the pre-industrial era, in which economically successful families were also more reproductively successful. They transmitted to their descendants, culturally and perhaps genetically, such productive attitudes as foresight, thrift, and devotion to hard work. This audacious thesis, which dismisses rival explanations in terms of prior ideological, technological, or institutional revolutions, will be debated by historians for many years to come."--<b>Paul Seabright, author of <i>The Company of Strangers: A Natural History of Economic Life</i></b></p><p>"Challenging the prevailing wisdom that institutions explain why some societies become rich, Gregory Clark's "A Farewell to Alms" will appeal to a broad audience. I can think of nothing else like it."--<b>Philip T. Hoffman, author of <i>Growth in a Traditional Society</i></b></p><p>"You may not always agree with Gregory Clark, but he will capture your attention, make you think, and make you reconsider. He is a provocative and imaginative scholar and a true original. As an economic historian, he engages with economists in general; as an economist, he is parsimonious with high-tech algebra and unnecessarily complex models. Occam would approve."--<b>Cormac Grda, author of <i>Jewish Ireland in the Age of Joyce</i></b></p><p>"This should rapidly become a standard work on the history of economic development. It should start whole industries trying to test, refine, and refute its explanations. And Gregory Clark's views on the economic merits of imperialism and the fact that labor gained the most from industrialization will infuriate all the right people."--<b>Eric L. Jones, author of <i>Cultures Merging</i> and <i>The European Miracle</i></b></p><p>"While many books on the Industrial Revolution tend to focus narrowly either on the event itself, or on one explanation for it, Gregory Clark does neither. He takes an extremely long-run view, covering significant periods before and after the Industrial Revolution, without getting bogged down in long or detailed exposition. This is an extremely important contribution to the subject."--<b>Clifford Bekar, Lewis and Clark College</b></p><b>Gregory Clark</b> is chair of the economics department at the University of California, Davis. He has written widely about economic history.</p><h2>Calculus Equations &amp; Answers</h2><p><p>For every student who has ever found the answer to a particular calculus equation elusive or a certain theorem impossible to remember, QuickStudy comes to the rescue!

With <b>Native Son</b> he gave us Bigger Thomas, still one of the most provocative and controversial characters in fiction. With <b>Black Boy</b> he offered a candid and searing depiction of racism and poverty in America. And now, forty years after his death, he has bestowed us with one of the finest collections of haiku in American literature.<br><br>Wright became enamored of haiku at the end of his life, and in this strict, seventeen-syllable form he discovered another way of looking at the world. He rendered images of nature and humanity that raised questions and revealed strikingly fresh perspectives. The publication of this collection is not only one of the greatest posthumous triumphs of American letters but also a final testament to the noble spirit and enduring artistry of Richard Wright.</p><p>"The only full collection of haiku by a major American writer to remotely suggest both the range and depth possible in the genre."--<i>The Santa Fe New Mexican</i><br><br>"<b>Haiku: This Other World</b> is an outstanding addition to Wright's literary and humanist achievements and stands as a beacon to this other world."--<i>The Japan Times</i><br><br>"A clutch of strong flowers."--Gwendolyn Brooks<br><br>Richard Wright was born in 1908 in rural Mississippi and died in Paris in 1960.

The Cat in the House</p> <p>When they had left Paris at around three o&#x2019;clock, the streets were still bustling in the chilly late-autumn sunshine. Shortly afterwards, near Mantes, the lights had come on in the train compartment. Darkness had fallen outside by the time they reached �vreux, and now, through windows streaming with droplets, they saw a thick mist gleaming in soft haloes around the track lights.</p> <p>Snug in his corner, resting his head against the back of the banquette, Detective Chief Inspector Maigret had not taken his half-closed eyes from the unlikely couple across from him.</p> <p>Captain Joris was asleep. His clothes were wrinkled, his wig askew on his gleaming pate.</p> <p>And Julie, clutching her imitation crocodile handbag, stared off into space while endeavouring, despite her fatigue, to look thoughtful.</p> <p>Joris! Julie!</p> <p>Inspector Maigret of the Police Judiciaire was used to having people suddenly take over his life like this, monopolize him for days, weeks, months, and then sink back into the anonymous crowd.</p> <p>The rhythmic sound of the wheels carried his thoughts along, and they were always the same at the beginning of each case: would this investigation be challenging or dull? Thankless and demoralizing, or painfully tragic?</p> <p>As Maigret considered Joris, a faint smile touched his lips. A strange fellow! And for five days back at Quai des Orf�vres, everyone had called him That Man, because they couldn&#x2019;t find out who he was.</p> <p>A man picked up for wandering in obvious distress among the cars and buses on the Grands Boulevards. Questioned in French, he remains mute. They try seven or eight languages. Nothing. Sign language proves fruitless as well.</p> <p>A madman? In Maigret&#x2019;s office, he is searched. His suit is new, his underwear is new, his shoes are new. All identifying labels have been removed. No identification papers. No wallet. Five crisp thousand-franc bills have been slipped into one of his pockets.</p> <p>The inquiry could not be more aggravating! Criminal records and case files are searched. Telegrams are sent at home and abroad. And although subjected to exhausting interrogation, That Man smiles affably all day long! A stocky fellow of about fifty, broad-shouldered, who neither protests nor gets upset, who smiles and sometimes seems to try to remember, but gives up almost immediately&nbsp;...</p> <p>Amnesia? When the wig slides off his head they discover that a bullet has pierced his skull not more than two months earlier. The doctors marvel: whoever operated on him displayed superb surgical skill.</p> <p>Fresh telegrams go out to hospitals and nursing homes in France, Belgium, Germany, Holland&nbsp;...</p> <p>Five whole days of these painstaking investigations. The absurd results obtained by analysing some stains on his clothing and fine debris from his pockets: traces of salted cod&#x2019;s roe, dried and pulverized on the far shores of Norway for sardine bait.</p> <p>Does That Man come from up there? Is he Scandinavian? There are indications that he has travelled a long way by train. But how can he have done this on his own, without speaking, with the befuddled appearance that makes him so conspicuous?</p> <p>His picture appears in the newspapers. A telegram arrives from Ouistreham: <i>Unknown man identified!</i></p> <p>The telegram is followed by a woman &#x2013; more of a girl, really &#x2013; who shows up in Maigret&#x2019;s office, her haggard face inexpertly rouged and powdered: Julie Legrand, the mystery man&#x2019;s maid.</p> <p>He is no longer That Man: he has a name and a profession. He is Yves Joris, formerly a captain in the merchant navy, now the harbourmaster at Ouistreham, a small port between Trouville and Cherbourg in Lower Normandy.</p> <p>Julie bursts into tears! Julie cannot understand! Julie begs him to speak to her! And he looks at her calmly, pleasantly, the way he looks at everyone.</p> <p>Captain Joris had disappeared from Ouistreham on 16 September. It is now the end of October.</p> <p>What has happened to him while he was missing for six weeks?</p> <p>&#x2018;He went out to the lock to work the tide, as usual. An evening tide. I went off to bed. The next morning, he wasn&#x2019;t in his room&nbsp;...&#x2019;</p> <p>On account of the fog that night, everyone thinks Joris had slipped and fallen into the water. They hunted for him with grappling hooks. Then they assumed he had simply gone off for some peculiar reason of his own.</p> <p>&#x2018;Lisieux!&nbsp;...&nbsp;Departure in three minutes!&#x2019;</p> <p>Maigret goes to stretch his legs on the platform and refill his pipe. He has smoked so much since Paris that the air in the compartment has turned grey.</p> <p>&#x2018;All aboard!&#x2019;</p> <p>In the meantime Julie has powdered her nose; her eyes are still a bit red from weeping.</p> <p>It&#x2019;s strange&nbsp;...&nbsp;There are moments when she is pretty, with a certain polish. At other times, though it would be hard to say why, she seems like a gauche little peasant.</p> <p>She straightens the wig on the captain&#x2019;s head, for <i>her monsieur</i>, as she puts it, and looks at Maigret as if to say: &#x2018;Haven&#x2019;t I every right to take care of him?&#x2019;</p> <p>For Joris has no family. He has lived alone, for years, with Julie, whom he calls his housekeeper.</p> <p>&#x2018;He treated me like his daughter&nbsp;...&#x2019;</p> <p>As far as anyone knows, he has no enemies! Has had no adventures, no love affairs, no grand passions!</p> <p>A man who, after sailing the seven seas for thirty years, could not resign himself to idleness and, despite his retirement, applied for the position of harbourmaster at Ouistreham. He had a small house built there&nbsp;...</p> <p>And one fine evening, on 16 September, he vanished &#x2013; then reappeared in Paris six weeks later in this sorry state.</p> <p>Having never seen him in anything but a naval officer&#x2019;s uniform, Julie had been dismayed to find him wearing an off-the-peg grey suit.</p> <p>She is anxious, uneasy. Whenever she looks at the captain, her face reflects both pity and a nameless fear, a haunting anguish. It really is him, obviously! It&#x2019;s <i>her monsieur</i>, all right. And yet, he is no longer completely himself.</p> <p>&#x2018;He&#x2019;ll get well again, won&#x2019;t he? I&#x2019;ll take good care of him&nbsp;...&#x2019;</p> <p>The mist is now turning into large, blurry drops on the windows. Maigret&#x2019;s big, stolid face rocks a little from side to side as the train rattles along. Placidly, he goes on watching his companions: Julie, who pointed out to him that they might just as well have travelled third class, as she normally does, and Joris, who is waking up only to look around him vacantly. One more stop, at Caen. Then on to Ouistreham.</p> <p>&#x2018;Around a thousand people live in the village,&#x2019; a colleague originally from there had told Maigret. &#x2018;The harbour is small but important, because of the canal linking the roadstead to the city of Caen. The canal can handle ships of five thousand tons or more.&#x2019;</p> <p>Maigret doesn&#x2019;t bother trying to imagine what the place looks like; he knows that&#x2019;s a fool&#x2019;s game. He waits, and his eyes keep turning to the wig, which hides the raw pink scar.</p> <p>When Captain Joris disappeared, he had thick, dark brown hair with only a touch of silver at the temples. Another torment for Julie, who can&#x2019;t bear the sight of his bare skull&nbsp;...&nbsp;Every time the wig slips, she quickly straightens it.</p> <p>&#x2018;In short, someone tried to kill him&nbsp;...&#x2019;</p> <p>He was shot, and that&#x2019;s a fact. But he was also given the very best of medical care. He had no money when he vanished &#x2013; yet was found with five thousand francs in his pocket.</p> <p>But there is more to come. Julie suddenly opens her handbag.</p> <p>&#x2018;I forgot! I brought along the captain&#x2019;s mail.&#x2019;</p> <p>Almost nothing. Brochures for marine supplies. A receipt for dues paid to the Association of Merchant Navy Captains. Postcards from friends still in the service, including one sent from Punta Arenas&nbsp;...</p> <p>A letter from the Banque de Normandie, in Caen. A printed form, the blanks filled in on a typewriter.</p> <p> </p><p>...&nbsp;beg to inform you that the sum of three hundred thousand francs has been transferred as per your instructions from the Dutch Bank in Hamburg and credited to your Account No. 14173&nbsp;...</p> <p></p> <p>And Julie has already insisted over and over that the captain is not a wealthy man! Maigret looks from one to the other of the pair seated across from him.</p> <p>Salted cod&#x2019;s roe&nbsp;...&nbsp;Hamburg&nbsp;...&nbsp;The made-in-Germany shoes&nbsp;...&nbsp;And only Joris could explain all this. Joris, who beams a nice broad smile his way because he sees that Maigret is looking at him&nbsp;...</p> <p>&#x2018;This station is Caen! Passengers for Cherbourg remain on board; change here for Ouistreham, Lion-sur-Mer, Luc&nbsp;...&#x2019;</p> <p>It is seven o&#x2019;clock. The air is so humid that the lights on the platform can barely shine through the milky mist.</p> <p>&#x2018;How do we go on to our destination now?&#x2019; Maigret asks Julie as the other passengers push past them.</p> <p>&#x2018;Well, the local train runs only twice a day in the winter&nbsp;...&#x2019;</p> <p>There are taxis outside the station. Maigret is hungry. Having no idea what awaits him in Ouistreham, he prefers to have dinner in the station buffet.</p> <p>Captain Joris is still behaving well and eats what he is served, like a child who trusts those in charge of him. A passing railway employee pauses at their table to consider the captain.</p> <p>&#x2018;Isn&#x2019;t that the harbourmaster of Ouistreham?&#x2019; he asks Maigret, and twirls a finger at his temple. At a nod from Maigret he goes on his way, visibly amazed.</p> <p>As for Julie, she takes refuge in practical matters.</p> <p>&#x2018;Twelve francs for a dinner like this, and it wasn&#x2019;t even cooked with butter! As if we couldn&#x2019;t simply have eaten when we got home&nbsp;...&#x2019;</p> <p>As she speaks, Maigret is thinking, &#x2018;A bullet in the head&nbsp;...&nbsp;Three hundred thousand francs&nbsp;...&#x2019;</p> <p>He stares searchingly into the captain&#x2019;s innocent eyes, while his mouth sets in a hard line.</p> <p>The next taxi in line, once a fine limousine, has lumpy seats and creaking joints. The three passengers must crowd together in the back because the jump seats are broken, and Julie is pinned between the two men, squashed by first one, then the other, as the car swerves.</p> <p>&#x2018;I&#x2019;m trying to remember if I locked the garden gate!&#x2019; she murmurs, increasingly concerned about her domestic duties as they get closer to the house.</p> <p>Leaving the village, they literally drive into a wall of fog.

In the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries thousands of women confessed to being witches&#x2014;of making pacts with the Devil, causing babies to sicken, and killing animals and crops&#x2014;and were put to death. This book is a gripping account of the pursuit, interrogation, torture, and burning of witches during this period and beyond.<br><br> Drawing on hundreds of original trial transcripts and other rare sources in four areas of Southern Germany, where most of the witches were executed, Lyndal Roper paints a vivid picture of their lives, families, and tribulations. She also explores the psychology of witch-hunting, explaining why it was mostly older women that were the victims of witch crazes, why they confessed to crimes, and how the depiction of witches in art and literature has influenced the characterization of elderly women in our own culture.</p></p><p>"The importance of Akhmatova&#x2019;s works in the Russian poetic tradition can scarcely be exaggerated.

Way: Management Insights and Leadership Secrets of the Legendary CEO</h2><p>Behind the scenes with the legendary CEO <p> Jack Welch&#x2019;s innovative leadership strategies revived a lagging GE, transforming it into a powerhouse with a staggering $300 billion-plus market capitalization. In writing Jack Welch and the GE Way, author Robert Slater was given unprecedented access to Welch and other prominent GE insiders. What emerged is a brilliant portrait that tells you what makes Jack Welch tick. Learn how to work the Welch magic on your own company as you find out how he dismantled the boundaries between management layers, between engineers and marketers, between GE and its customers to streamline the process of getting products and services to market. </p><p> Get details on Welch&#x2019;s far-reaching Six Sigma quality initiative, and discover how its principles and standards can save billions of dollars...how and why he has made GE a truly global company (and why you must think global as well)...and all the other Welch "midas touch" strategies you can put to work in your organization, at every level!</p></p><p>A recent <i>Fortune</i> poll cited General Electric Company as America's most admired company. Much of the credit went to Jack Welch, GE's chief executive for the past 17 years. During his tenure, GE's revenues and profits have grown enormously. Its share price has soared, making GE the world's most valuable company. And the key to GE's success, according to <i>Jack Welch and the GE Way</i>, is Welch's fanatical devotion to a personal philosophy of leadership. Author Robert Slater has made a growth industry of his own out of Welch, penning two previous books on him, <i>The New GE</i> in 1992 and <i>Get Better or Get Beaten!</i> two years later. The same territory was plowed in 1993 by Noel M. Tichy and Stratford Sherman in <i>Control Your Destiny or Someone Else Will</i>. <p> In this book, Slater draws extensively on Welch's own words to deliver his now familiar message: keep it simple; face reality; embrace change; fight bureaucracy. Bromides these may be, but Slater's account of Welch's fierce efforts to lead a global, multifarious organization of 270,000 people does inspire admiration, even if it does not enable emulation. The book provides fresh insights into GE's shift toward service businesses, as with its takeover and transformation of NBC. Most timely are Welch's closing thoughts on trends in the global economy. <i>Jack Welch and the GE Way</i> is a must for the legions of "Welch-heads" out there and for anyone else interested in this brilliant leader's perspective on the future of business. <i>--Barry Mitzman</i></p><p>Get inside the mind of Jack Welch, GE's bold innovator.</p> <p>"Jack Welch is a genius at making all who work for him raise the level of their game. We've had some friendly differences but we always find common ground; I think he's the smartest boss I've ever had and he signs my pay checks!"</p> <p>��Tom Brokaw, Anchor and Managing Editor "NBC Nightly News with Tom Brokaw".</p> <p>"If leadership is an art, then surely Welch has proved himself a master painter."</p> <p>��<i>BusinessWeek</i> on Jack Welch.</p> <p>Jack Welch doesn't believe in sitting still. His innovative, breakthrough leadership strategies as CEO have transformed GE into a highly productive, labor-efficient powerhouse��with a staggering $200 billion-plus market capitalization. Now, at long last, senior managers and other executives can discover how to work the Welch magic on their own companies.</p> <p>"Act like a leader, not a manager." <i>Jack Welch and the GE Way</i> reveals the strategies and secrets that have led to Jack Welch's stunning success. Veteran international business journalist Robert Slater, given unprecedented access to Welch and other prominent GE insiders, has crafted a brilliant portrait of what makes Jack Welch tick. "Use the brains of every worker." Jack Welch is a man with a mission. Even though he has reached the summit of success, Welch continues to shake the cage��and GE continues to be the envy of its global competitors. Read <i>Jack Welch and the GE Way</i>, and learn for yourself the insights and strategies that Jack Welch used to create the most valuable corporation in history.</p></p><h2>The Busy Person&#39;s Guide to Preserving Food: Easy Step-by-Step Instructions for Freezing, Drying, and Canning</h2><p>Offers instructions for processing and preserving common fruits and vegetables, and includes recipes featuring produce frozen, dried, and canned at home</p><p>The Updated and Expanded Edition of Garden Way Publishing's Classic Guide<p> Discover the fast, easy way to save and preserve fresh and healthy fruits, vegetables, and herbs with this indispensable guide.

With this focus on history as a process, MAKING AMERICA encourages readers to think historically and to develop into citizens who value the past. The clear chronology, straightforward narrative, and strong thematic structure emphasize communication over intimidation and appeal to readers of varied learning levels. The Brief Sixth Edition retains a hallmark feature of the MAKING AMERICA program: pedagogical tools that allow readers to master complex material and enable them to develop analytical skills. Every chapter has chapter outlines, chronologies, focus questions, and on-page glossaries (defining both key terms and general vocabulary) to provide guidance throughout the text; the open, inviting design allows readers to access and use pedagogy to improve learning. A wealth of images throughout provides a visual connection to the past, with captions that help readers analyze the subject of the painting, photograph, or artifact from an historical point of view. &#34;Investigating America&#34; gets to the heart of learning history: reading and analyzing primary sources. A new feature, &#34;In The Wider World&#34; introduces a global perspective for each chapter. In addition, a new map program provides clear, visually engaging maps with globe insets to put the map in a global context. Available in the following split options: MAKING AMERICA, Brief Sixth Edition Complete, Volume 1: To 1877, and Volume 2: Since 1865.

But when Willow&#x2019;s brother, Rex (the bro-iest bro ever to don a jockstrap), starts throwing wild parties, the idyllic senior citizens&#x2019; community where they live is transformed into a war zone.

Follow her on Twitter at @ae_kaplan.Chapter One<br><br>When I was nine years old, on the nineteen-�day anniversary of my mother&#x2019;s sudden and unexpected death, I had the unfortunate experience of visiting the world&#x2019;s worst family counselor.<br><br>It was still not entirely real yet, my mother&#x2019;s death, and I vacillated between crying and waiting for her to come home and tell me that everyone had made a huge mistake, that it hadn&#x2019;t been her who had a stroke at the kitchen table, but the neighbor, or some random woman off the street who had wandered into our house and died in my mother&#x2019;s chair while we were at school.<br><br>Anyway, there we were, listening to the counselor give her phony condolences, and then she went on to explain that my mother&#x2019;s life was a sentence and her death was a punctuation mark. It was up to us, she said, to decide whether to view Mom&#x2019;s death as a period (boo) or an exclamation point (yay!). I sat there numbly and watched the clock, grateful that the hour-�long session would only run fifty minutes, and wishing that we were further in than minute fourteen.<br><br>On minute fifteen, my sister, who up to this point had appeared three-�quarters asleep, sat up and said, &#x201c;What about a semicolon? Could death be a semicolon?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I,&#x201d; said the counselor. &#x201c;Well. Um.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Or an asterisk? Or an ellipsis? Maybe if you believe in reincarnation, it&#x2019;s an ellipsis.&#x201d; I frowned, because I did not yet know what an ellipsis was, while Zip turned to look at my dad, saying, &#x201c;Do we believe in reincarnation?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Zipora,&#x201d; the counselor said.<br><br>&#x201c;Comma!&#x201d; Zip shouted. &#x201c;Ampersand!&#x201d;<br><br>At that point I stood up, sputtering but emboldened by the wisdom of my sister&#x2019;s accrued fourteen years, and screamed, &#x201c;QUESTION MARK!&#x201d;<br><br>Whereupon my father took my sister and me by the hand and walked us out of the office, down to the car, and drove us through the nearest McDonald&#x2019;s drive-�thru, where we ordered French fries that we ate silently in the parking lot.<br><br>Needless to say, we never went back, but even now, eight years later, I have trouble thinking of death without also thinking of punctuation. It&#x2019;s an unfortunate side effect of being a kid, I guess: you have no control over what people say to you, or what will stick. If I had a choice about what I remembered most from age nine, I guarantee Punctuation Lady would not have made the list, but there you go (period).<br><br>###<br><br>And so it was that on the day I heard of my next-�door neighbor&#x2019;s death, I thought (randomly): Parentheses.<br><br>I was mowing her lawn at the time I heard; it was around ten in the morning, the best possible time for mowing grass in the summer, if there is a best time for mowing grass in the summer. It was hot but not horribly so, and the mosquitoes were at a reasonable level.<br><br>I was pushing my heavy, nonelectric push mower, thinking, as I usually did, that there is something profoundly enjoyable about pushing a manual lawn mower. I&#x2019;m not sure if it&#x2019;s the noise&#x2014;�a sort of whooshing whir that sounds a little bit like a hamster running on a wheel&#x2014;�or if it&#x2019;s the way your muscles burn when you have to push up a hill, or if it&#x2019;s just watching the piles of cut grass fall on the freshly trimmed lawn. There&#x2019;s something satisfying about the whole affair that you just don&#x2019;t get from a power mower.<br><br>At any rate, I was pushing my trusty manual across my next-�door neighbors&#x2019; expansive lawn when I heard of the untimely demise of Minnie Taylor. It shouldn&#x2019;t have been much of a shock&#x2014;�she&#x2019;d been like three hundred years old&#x2014;�but still. I&#x2019;d seen her just the day before, standing outside in her unfortunately sheer nightgown, calling her herd of cats inside for dinner. I hadn&#x2019;t imagined that would be the last time I&#x2019;d see Mrs. Taylor ensconced in her substantial under�garments, waving a bag of Friskies and screaming.<br><br>Minnie lived next door with Allison McArdle, who&#x2019;d been her partner for thirty years, the last two of which had been legally recognized (I was at the wedding; they both wore purple and huge hats). Anyway, Minnie and Allison had like twelve cats, which were always getting in the way when I was mowing the lawn, even though cats are supposed to be afraid of lawn mowers, even manual ones. So I was trying to push one of these idiot creatures out of the way with my foot when I stepped in some cat poop, which was massively annoying because (a) it stinks like the devil wrapped in goat cheese, and (b) I&#x2019;d just bought the shoes I was wearing the week before.<br><br>I stopped mowing, and Mr. Boots, the fat one, came over and started rubbing against my leg while I wiped the sole of my shoe on the damp grass. It was July, and July in Virginia is sort of damp and disgusting. The air. The grass. My sweat-�coated body. You didn&#x2019;t walk through the air so much as swim through it.<br><br>So I was trying to rub the poop off my shoe and fend off the attentions of Mr. Boots when Allison came hobbling out the front door with her walker.<br><br>&#x201c;Sorry, Mrs. McArdle,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m almost done here. I just got a little hung up in some, uh, cat feces.&#x201d;<br><br>Allison always fancied herself very modern. &#x201c;You can say shit to me, Tommy,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s okay.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, ma&#x2019;am.&#x201d;<br><br>She took a long look at me while I rubbed the sole of my shoe on her grass, then sighed. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t suppose you heard about Minnie.&#x201d;<br><br>I stopped the business with my shoe and looked up. &#x201c;No, ma&#x2019;am, I didn&#x2019;t. Is she all right?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;She passed away this morning,&#x201d; she said.<br><br>You would think that living on a street where I was one of two people under the age of seventy (the other person being my father), I would get used to hearing that people have died. I mean, Minnie&#x2019;s was not the first death I&#x2019;d heard of in the last year, or even in the last month. Lake Heorot was something of a retirement mecca, recently developed and mainly populated by women long since collecting Social Security.<br><br>So I shouldn&#x2019;t have been shocked or particularly upset by Minnie&#x2019;s death, but I was. She&#x2019;d been my friend, and she told great stories, some of which might even have been true. She had afternoon barbecues twice a year that I was always invited to, and she took good care of the flowers in front of her house, which made my father unreasonably happy. There was a vase in my dining room full of Minnie&#x2019;s zinnias, which, I think, reminded him of my mother, though he&#x2019;d never actually say so.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m so sorry,&#x201d; I said, which was a stupid platitude, but I never know what to say when somebody dies. No matter what comes out, it&#x2019;s never enough, and the harder you try, the worse you seem to do. I grabbed hold of the mower. &#x201c;I really shouldn&#x2019;t be bothering you with the lawn mower today,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll just pack up&#x2014;�&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You aren&#x2019;t bothering me, honey,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Minnie was always so fond of you. Come inside now, won&#x2019;t you? There&#x2019;s something I want to give you.&#x201d;<br><br>I followed her inside, which took about ten minutes because that&#x2019;s how long it took Mrs. McArdle to get her walker turned around and back up the porch, and she sat me down in the living room, facing Minnie&#x2019;s teapot collection in its glass case.<br><br>&#x201c;Wouldn&#x2019;t you like some tea, dear?&#x201d; Allison had a particular penchant for chamomile tea, which I hate. But my father told me years ago that when an old lady offers you tea, you had better accept it.<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, ma&#x2019;am,&#x201d; I said.<br><br>From my perch on the couch, I could hear Allison puttering around in the kitchen, and I thought about the fact that Minnie Taylor was lying deceased in the bed upstairs, when she&#x2019;d been outside in her unbelted dressing gown and her vast granny underpants only half a day earlier. Death is like that, I suppose. One moment you&#x2019;re feeling the breeze under your clothes, and the next it&#x2019;s all over.<br><br>I also wondered if Mrs. McArdle ought to be calling someone about, you know, the dead body, rather than serving me too-�sweet tea. I didn&#x2019;t say anything, though, because you really can&#x2019;t point out a corpse in someone else&#x2019;s home. It&#x2019;s just rude.<br><br>Anyway, I was thinking of Minnie lying up there, gone on to her final rest in her fading purple nightgown. And then, there was Minnie coming down the stairs in that selfsame purple nightgown.<br><br>Two things occurred to me at once. The first was that I was seeing a ghost. The second was that Minnie looked rather annoyed for a dead person.<br><br>All I could think to say was &#x201c;Holy shit.&#x201d;<br><br>Minnie (who was ten years older than Allison and not nearly so modern) cut me a dirty look. &#x201c;There&#x2019;ll be none of that kind of talk in here, mister,&#x201d; she snapped, which is how I knew that she was definitely not dead.<br><br>Allison came running in, or as close to running as Allison got. &#x201c;Minnie!&#x201d; she shouted. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re alive!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Of course I&#x2019;m alive, you dolt!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;But you weren&#x2019;t breathing!&#x201d;<br><br>Minnie stopped at the bottom of the stairs and crossed her arms. &#x201c;Apparently, I was.&#x201d;<br><br>Allison opened her mouth to argue back, hands on her hips, when the doorbell rang.<br><br>&#x201c;Tom, you get that, would you?&#x201d;<br><br>I answered it; it was Troy Tucker, who graduated from my high school a few years ago. No one had predicted any particular greatness from Troy, and he&#x2019;d lived up to those expectations. I stood staring at his rather ill-�fitting black suit, then I remembered that these days he worked for Green&#x2019;s Funeral Home.<br><br>He nodded at me. &#x201c;You here to pay your respects?&#x201d; he said.<br><br>&#x201c;Well, uh, actually . . . ,&#x201d; I began.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m here to collect the remains,&#x201d; he explained.<br><br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t bother!&#x201d; Minnie shouted from the foot of the stairs. &#x201c;The remains are perfectly fine where they are, thank you!&#x201d;<br><br>Troy looked to me in confusion. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t entirely under�stand.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;The reports of my death have been greatly exaggerated!&#x201d; Minnie hollered.<br><br>He shifted from one foot to another. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t . . . um . . .&#x201d;<br><br>Allison threw her arms in the air. &#x201c;She&#x2019;s not dead, you idiot!&#x201d;<br><br>Minnie snorted. &#x201c;Careful where you throw that label, Allie. Remember who thought I&#x2019;d gone to the great beyond in the first place!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You were dead! I swear it!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I was not dead!&#x201d;<br><br>Troy crossed his arms over his chest. &#x201c;But I came all this way,&#x201d; he said, looking from one of them to the other, as if to say he wasn&#x2019;t leaving empty-�handed.<br><br>Minnie shuffled forward and shooed Troy back toward the door. &#x201c;There is nobody dead here. So you can go about your business. I&#x2019;m terribly sorry for your trouble.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;But I put on my suit! I used six dollars&#x2019; worth of gas!&#x201d;<br><br>I could tell this had the potential to go on for a while, so I edged my way out the front door. Just as I closed it behind me, I heard Troy call out, &#x201c;You already called Thompson and Frith, didn&#x2019;t you? They stole half our bodies last month!&#x201d;<br><br>Thompson and Frith is the name of the funeral parlor on the other side of town. Masonberg really isn&#x2019;t big enough to warrant two funeral homes, but that&#x2019;s how many old people we have.<br><br>I was pushing my lawn mower back to the garage when I heard Troy slam the door and peel off in Mr. Green&#x2019;s twenty-�year-�old hearse.<br><br>Two weeks later, Minnie and Allison moved into an assisted-�living facility way down in Key West, I suppose so they could have their vitals measured by actual professionals while lying on chaise lounges and drinking Hemingway daiquiris. The following weekend, Ellen Rothgar, Allison&#x2019;s niece, moved in with her two kids, Rex and Willow.<br><br>I had no idea I would miss stepping in cat shit so desperately.

Author Darcy Lever compiled the text for "a young gentleman whose inclinations at that time led him to the choice of a sea-faring life," and he later expanded its contents for the general use of young officers in the Royal Navy and East India Company.<br>Starting with a precise explanation of the principles of rigging, the text proceeds to a well-defined account of a ship's operation through the effect of the wind on its sails. Tacking, use of a compass, the art of swinging a ship at single anchor, casting, and numerous other aspects of seamanship receive close attention and clear definitions. Detailed drawings accompany the ample directions for splicing ropes, making sails, and other practical measures; indeed, every other page of this book features clear, well-drawn illustrations of the procedure under discussion and its execution.<br>This rare volume, an authentic look at the maritime world of the 19th century, belongs in the library of every ship fancier, model builder, and naval historian.</p><p></p></p><p></p><h2>Beyond Sex Roles,: What the Bible Says About a Woman&#x2019;s Place in Church and Family</h2><p>A first-rate biblical and theological study that affirms full equality of the sexes in church and family.</p><p>In this engaging biblical and theological study, Gilbert Bilezikian offers an accessible examination of the key texts of Scripture pertinent to understanding female roles. <i>Beyond Sex Roles</i> affirms full equality of the sexes in family and church, advocating an interpretive method that sees God's revelation of himself and his will as progressive. Using a creation-fall-redemption hermeneutical model, this book helps readers develop a coherent method of interpretation for understanding the roles of women in church and family.<p>The book's study-guide format is designed for either individual investigation or group work. Bilezikian deliberately avoids using scholarly jargon and complex argumentation in the main text of the book to encourage readers to interact with the biblical research. The aim is for non-specialized readers to be able to follow his discussion step-by-step, evaluate arguments, consider alternative views, and arrive at independent conclusions.</p><p>"Because Bilezikian presents his thesis with an obvious and unqualified submission to the Word of Scripture, his work is profoundly significant."--Hendrik Hart, <i>Calvin Theological Journal</i></p><p>"Although some will disagree with Bilezikian's conclusions, <i>Beyond Sex Roles</i> provides much food for thought to men and women concerned with being obedient to God in how they conduct their relationships."--<i>Today's Christian Woman</i></p><b>Gilbert Bilezikian</b> (ThD, Boston University) is professor of biblical studies emeritus at Wheaton College.

It is a word with which we are universally familiar, and a condition that haunts the human imagination. In this <em>Very Short Introduction</em>, Andrew Scull provides a provocative and entertaining examination of the social, cultural, medical, and artistic responses to mental disturbance across more than two millennia, concluding with some observations on the contemporary accounts of mental illness. He shows that through the centuries, in poetry and in prose, in drama and in the visual arts, madness has been on display for all to see. He also describes how a whole industry has grown up, devoted to its management and suppression. Perhaps most important, he conveys how madness profoundly disturbs our common sense assumptions; threatens the social order, both symbolically and practically; creates almost unbearable disruptions in the texture of daily living; and turns our experience and our expectations upside down. Throughout this fascinating history, many fascinating and arresting pictures illuminate the overall portrait of madness in its various contexts.<br></p><p><br><strong>Andrew Scull</strong> is Distinguished Professor of Sociology and Science Studies at the University of California, San Diego.

Walter Hartright's mysterious midnight encounter with the woman in white draws him into a vortex of crime, poison, kidnapping, and international intrigue. This new critical edition is the first to use the original manuscript of the novel. John Sutherland examines Collins's contribution to Victorian fiction, traces his practices as a creator of plot, and provides a chronology of the novel's complicated events.<br><br><strong>About the Series: </strong>For over 100 years <strong>Oxford World's Classics</strong> has made available the broadest spectrum of literature from around the globe. Each affordable volume reflects Oxford's commitment to scholarship, providing the most accurate text plus a wealth of other valuable features, including expert introductions by leading authorities, voluminous notes to clarify the text, up-to-date bibliographies for further study, and much more.</p><p>"There in the middle of the broad, bright high-road-there, as if it had that moment sprung out of the earth or dropped from the heaven-stood the figure of a solitary woman, dressed from head to foot in white garments." Thus young Walter Hartright first meets the mysterious woman in white in what soon became one of the most popular novels of the nineteenth century. Secrets, mistaken identities, surprise revelations, amnesia, locked rooms and locked asylums, and an unorthodox villain made this mystery thriller an instant success when it first appeared in 1860, and it has continued to enthrall readers ever since. From the hero's foreboding before his arrival at Limmeridge House to the nefarious plot concerning the beautiful Laura, the breathtaking tension of Collin's narrative created a new literary genre of suspense fiction, which profoundly shaped the course of English popular writing. Collins other great mystery, <i>The Moonstone</i>, has been called the finest detective story ever written, but it was this work that so gripped the imagination of the world that Wilkie Collins had his own tombstone inscribed: "Author of <i>The Woman In White</i>. . . "On a lonely moonlit road, a young drawing teacher meets a mysterious woman, dressed all in white, only to be struck by her eerie resemblance to his pupil, the beautiful heiress Laura Fairlie. Who is this ghostly woman in white? And what secret does she hold over Sir Percival Glyde, Laura s sinister fianc�? This gripping dramatization of the classic Victorian suspense novel opens in a London courtroom, where an inquiry into Laura s suspicious death is underway. As various characters recount the weeks leading up to her marriage and sudden illness, Collins s chilling tale of love, greed, and insanity springs to life with the aid of a brilliant cast, including Stratford Festival star Douglas Campbell as the diabolical Count Fosco.</p><h2>Just Breathe: Mastering Breathwork</h2><p>Hailed by Tony Robbins as the &#x201c;definitive breathwork handbook,&#x201d; <i>Just Breathe </i>will teach you how to harness your breath to reduce stress, increase productivity, balance your health, and find the path to spiritual awakening.<br><br>Big meeting jitters?

I was in the first grade at a Catholic school in New Bedford, Massachusetts. The pastor of our church made the first of his weekly visits to our classroom that Friday morning.<br> <br>We all sat in awe of this very stern-looking old guy dressed in a long black robe with a bright red cape, holding a leather-bound Bible, its pages trimmed with gold leaf. We were all afraid. For all we knew, God could strike us dead if we didn&#x2019;t listen and behave. (Yes, I am a recovering &#x201c;Cathaholic.&#x201d;)<br> <br>Switching back and forth between French and English, he talked about heaven. That was nice. And he talked about hell&#x2014;definitely not nice. He told us how if we were not very, very careful, and if we did not do exactly as we were told, we would all end up in that terrible place forever! Then he read from the book of Genesis and told us how: &#x201c;God took the dust of the earth and formed the body of man; and breathed into the nostrils of man the breath of life; and man became a living soul.&#x201d;<br> <br>To say that those words made an impression on me would be a huge understatement. I was smitten! I began to feel uncontrollable and unimaginable excitement at the thought that God was breathing into me. It was the most amazing thing I had ever heard, and I couldn&#x2019;t understand why everyone else wasn&#x2019;t excited about it like me.<br> <br>I couldn&#x2019;t sit still. I couldn&#x2019;t shut up. I think I was in a state of rapture. I know I became too animated, and I guess I disrupted the class, because I remember the monsignor&#x2019;s hands on my shoulders: he was forcing me to sit back down in my chair.<br> <br>Either because of him or in spite of him, something in me was definitely awakened that day. I sensed there was something magical, mystical, something wonderful and beautiful about breathing, and no amount of guilt, fear, force, shame, or cajoling was going to change or erase it. This was the spark that lit a fire in me, and to this day, I remain utterly fascinated&#x2014;more than ever in fact&#x2014;with breath and breathing, and with the power and potential of breathwork.<br> <br>From that moment of revelation, my personal path of breathwork took me on an incredible adventure from an X-ray technology program in Boston, and then into the US Navy during the Vietnam War era as an independent hospital corpsman, deep-sea diver, and emergency rescue specialist. I trained CPR and first-aid instructors, EMTs, and other emergency responders; developed the first stress and coping program for the American Red Cross; and designed a master&#x2019;s program called &#x201c;The Breath as a Tool for Health, Growth, and Change&#x201d; at Lesley University in Cambridge.<br> <br>Breathing training led me to study in India with yogi masters; to the Academy of Chinese Medicine in Beijing; and to the Russian Academy of Science in Moscow. I&#x2019;ve learned methods of breathing from Zen Buddhism, from Rebirthing with Leonard Orr, from Holotropic Breathwork with Stan Grof, and other sources.<br> <br>Recently, breathwork led me to Silicon Valley, to the Nissan-Renault Group&#x2019;s Research Labs. This automaker developed a prototype of a car that integrates a breathing feature into the driver&#x2019;s and passenger&#x2019;s seats. A mechanism in the seat, taken from Innovzen&#x2019;s O2 Chair, moves in a way that promotes and supports full, relaxed breathing. It was an honor to present and fun to demonstrate the concept of &#x201c;onboard breathing&#x201d; to the CEO and his team. In the next few years as self-driving cars hit the highways, we&#x2019;ll have more free time to focus on other things, like energizing and relaxing ourselves on the way to and from work.<br> <br>All of these experiences have been the deep well where I&#x2019;ve drawn from many different schools and styles of breathing to create a unique and diverse program for breathing training. That&#x2019;s why my martial artist friends call me &#x201c;the Bruce Lee of breathwork.&#x201d; I&#x2019;m not saying I&#x2019;m like Bruce Lee, but one trait we do have in common is the willingness to think outside the box and uncover every stone&#x2014;to share the best from all of our teachers&#x2014;and the dedication and dream to teach what we have learned to anyone ready and willing to do the work.<br> What Is Breathwork?<p></p> <br>Breathwork is the use of Breath Awareness and Conscious Breathing for healing and growth, personal awakening, and transformation in spirit, mind, and body. All the breathing techniques you&#x2019;ll learn in this book have this definition at their core. Breathwork falls into the field of self-improvement and personal development. It is a self-help, self-healing method in alternative medicine. It is also a key to spiritual purification and self-mastery. It is the most holistic and complementary approach to health care, and it is an essential part of any genuine spiritual development program.<br> <br>Here is a partial list of settings and situations where breathwork is now being taught and applied, courtesy of Dr. Peter Litchfield (President of the Graduate School of Behavioral Health Services):<br> <br>Alternative Health Care<br> <br>Anger Management<br> <br>Athletic Coaching<br> <br>Attention Training<br> <br>Biofeedback<br> <br>Bodywork<br> <br>Childbirth<br> <br>Chiropractic<br> <br>Corporate Training<br> <br>Counseling<br> <br>Dentistry<br> <br>Drug Abuse Prevention<br> <br>Drug Rehabilitation<br> <br>Education (all levels)<br> <br>Fitness Training<br> <br>Flight Training (aviation)<br> <br>Martial Arts<br> <br>Medicine<br> <br>Meditation<br> <br>Midwifery<br> <br>Military Training<br> <br>Neurofeedback<br> <br>Nursing<br> <br>Occupational Therapy<br> <br>Orthodontics<br> <br>Pain Management<br> <br>Peak Performance Training<br> <br>Performing Arts<br> <br>Personal Coaching<br> <br>Physical Therapy<br> <br>Psychology<br> <br>Public Speaking<br> <br>Respiratory Therapy<br> <br>Self-regulation Learning<br> <br>Skill Acquisition<br> <br>Social Work<br> <br>Speech Therapy<br> <br>Stress Management<br> <br>Test Taking<br> <br>Trauma and PTSD<br> <br>Yoga<br> <br>Zen<br> <br>More and more people are waking up to the incredible value of breathwork, and they are applying it in their everyday lives at work and at home. Coaches, health-care professionals, counselors, trainers, teachers, and therapists are using it to create breakthroughs for themselves and for those they serve. For spiritual seekers, it&#x2019;s a direct path to spiritual awakening, self-realization, and enlightenment. That&#x2019;s why breathwork is a major skill set that high-performing and successful individuals have mastered&#x2014;it&#x2019;s the secret ingredient that puts them exactly where they want to be.<br> <br>I teach breathwork as a formula for personal transformation in which three basic skills or elements are taught:<br> <br>Awareness (the consciousness factor): The message is &#x201c;wake up!&#x201d;<br> <br>Relaxation (the release factor): The message is &#x201c;let go!&#x201d;<br> <br>Breathing (the energy factor): The message is &#x201c;take charge!&#x201d;<br> <br>I have found that no matter what method is used, or what label is given to it, every miracle event; every healing experience; every positive shift, emotional release, or behavioral change&#x2014;every bit of growth can be linked to one of these three elements. Real power and magic comes from blending them and simultaneously engaging in these three elements deliberately and consistently. In practice we increase, expand, and refine our awareness. We use the breath to relax more quickly and deeply, and in more situations. And we learn breath control that results in more energy and aliveness, comfort and pleasure, and personal power and resilience.<br> <br>I also call what I do breath therapy, which is based on two key ideas:<br> <br>1. The breathing system in most people is not functioning at an optimal level. We need to heal it. We need to improve or restore our breathing capacity, to correct any dysfunctional habits or patterns that inhibit or interfere with the free expression our true nature and full potential.<br> <br>2. Once our breathing is full and free, healthy and natural, once it is restored or raised to an optimal level, then it automatically becomes a therapeutic tool. The body and breath can be used to heal the mind, and the mind and breath can be used to heal the body. Breathwork can be used to heal attitudes, emotions, and behaviors.<br> <br>There are five principles of breath therapy. These principles came about as I searched for the answer to this question: &#x201c;Why do dramatic positive results&#x2014;even miracles&#x2014;happen as a result of breathing sessions, and not in other kinds of therapeutic sessions?&#x201d; The answer to that lies in the application of these five principles:<br> <br>1. The technique (there are many techniques, each with a certain purpose or effect).<br> <br>2. The atmosphere in which one practices (physical/psychological/emotional/energetic).<br> <br>3. The teacher (making use of the &#x201c;power and purity of our personal presence&#x201d;).<br> <br>4. The mind of the breather (thoughts, beliefs, attitudes, intentions, desires, will).<br> <br>5. The &#x201c;something else&#x201d; (a mystical or magical factor: luck, grace, timing, readiness).<br> BREATHE NOW: HOW ARE YOU BREATHING?<p></p> <br>Let&#x2019;s try a quick exercise.<br> <br>A healthy person should be able to breathe both low in the belly, as well as high in the chest, easily and at will. You should be able to breathe slowly: two or three breaths per minute. And you should be able to breathe quickly: sixty or even 120 breaths per minute. When sitting at rest, your breathing should be low and slow.<br> <br>How are you breathing? Observe and sense your breathing right now.<br> <br>Put one hand over your belly and one hand over the center of your chest, and monitor your breathing. How does it feel to breathe? What moves when you breathe? Where does the breath go? Are you a chest breather? A belly breather? Is your breathing fast and shallow, or is it slow and deep? Is it smooth and regular, or choppy and chaotic? Are there pauses in the breathing?<br> <br>As with any art or skill, the key to excellence or greatness is in understanding and applying the fundamentals. Even the world&#x2019;s greatest musicians practice the scales before a performance. You will go a lot further and a lot faster if you start with the basics and keep returning to them. When it comes to breathwork, there are two basic aspects: Breath Awareness and Conscious Breathing. You can think of these as yin and yang, active and passive aspects of the practice.<br> Breath Awareness: Being the Breath<p></p> <br>Breath Awareness means paying close attention to the breath as you allow it to come and go on its own, by itself. The idea is to simply observe your breathing, watch the breath, witness it. No need to breathe in any particular way. This is the passive aspect. It is the practice of pure awareness applied to breathing.<br> <br>The awareness we are talking about is meditative awareness. It is not thinking, not judging, not comparing, not analyzing; you are not trying to figure out anything or do anything right. In fact, Breath Awareness is not really something you &#x201c;do.&#x201d; We are talking about a soft, open state of alertness and presence. Breath Awareness is a mindfulness practice. I also call it &#x201c;breath watching.&#x201d; In fact I use the terms interchangeably. It is attention training. All you need to do is decide to focus on your breathing and to observe it, sense it, moment to moment.<br> BREATHE NOW: SENSE YOUR BREATHING<p></p> <br>Bring your attention to the breath. Focus on your breathing. Sense your breathing. Observe it, listen to it, feel it. Witness it. How do you know you are breathing? What feelings and sensations tell you that you are breathing? Where do those feelings and sensations occur? Where does the breath go when it flows into you? What does it touch? What moves when you breathe? What muscles do you use?<br> <br>As you become more aware of the breath, you naturally become more aware of other things occurring in your mind and body: thoughts and images, feelings and sensations, perceptions and emotions. You may become more aware of your physical tensions, energetic contractions, habits, patterns, urges, reactions, and inner dialogue.<br> <br>A very important part of Breath Awareness is simply to witness these various phenomena; notice them without judging, resisting, or attaching to them. If you get distracted by these things, or if your mind wanders off on a tangent, no problem, just return your attention to your breathing and fully focus on the next breath. Look for details in the breathing that perhaps you have never noticed before.<br> <br>With practice, you will naturally move toward a place of freedom and inner peace, and the realization that nothing is happening to you: it is simply happening! You will develop a natural ease and a greater sense of aliveness. Ultimately you will realize that you are always and already free, no matter what you think or how you feel.<br> <br>Because of the power and potential of this fundamental practice, we are going to spend a lot of time on it, and we&#x2019;ll keep coming back to it, especially in chapter 4, &#x201c;Breathing to Transform Your Spirit.&#x201d;<br> Conscious Breathing: Doing the Breathing<p></p> <br>The second basic aspect of breathwork is Conscious Breathing. This is where you come in. You are an active participant in the breathing process, more than the witness. Conscious Breathing means that you deliberately control, direct, and regulate the breathing in some way. You give the breathing a certain quality or a specific pattern. You breathe with a conscious intention. You are creative.<br> <br>With Breath Awareness, the breath breathes you; with Conscious Breathing, you breathe the breath.<br> <br>An example of a Conscious Breathing exercise is to breathe at a rate of four to eight breaths per minute, which is considered to be a &#x201c;therapeutic zone&#x201d; since it has so many naturally therapeutic benefits. So let&#x2019;s begin with an average of six breaths per minute. That means a five-second inhale and a five second exhale.<br> BREATHE NOW: REGULATE YOUR BREATHING<p></p> <br>Breathe in for a count of five seconds, and breathe out for a count of five seconds. Spend some time settling in to this rhythm. Make your breathing pattern smooth and steady, inhaling for five seconds and exhaling for five seconds. Simple isn&#x2019;t it?<br> <br>Start by focusing on your breathing. At first simply being aware of it, observe it, then begin to gently bring it under your conscious control. Let the breaths be smooth and steady and rhythmic, inhaling for five seconds and exhaling for five seconds:<br> <br>Inhale, 2, 3, 4, 5<br> <br>Exhale, 2, 3, 4, 5<br> <br>Inhale, 2, 3, 4, 5<br> <br>Exhale, 2, 3, 4, 5<br> <br>How do you feel after a few minutes of this practice? If you find it difficult to breathe that slowly, then use a count of two or three or four to start. Or just count faster!<br> <br>If this rhythm is quite easy, experiment with a count of eight, ten, or twelve, or count more slowly. In any case, don&#x2019;t push, don&#x2019;t force, don&#x2019;t stress, or strain. Relax. Be patient with yourself as you practice.<br> <br>We will play with many other Conscious Breathing exercises and techniques in the coming chapters, but start with this one to begin a daily practice.

The two epic poems attributed to Homer, <i>The Iliad</i> and <i>The Odyssey</i>, both concern the Trojan War, a central event in Greek history and brilliantly rendered into myth in Homer&#x2019;s works. The seed of the Trojan War was planted when the Trojan prince Paris judged a beauty contest between the three goddesses Hera, Athena, and Aphrodite. Each attempted to bribe Paris; Hera with land, Athena with the skills of a warrior, and Aphrodite with the love of the most beautiful woman in the world, Helen of Sparta. Paris chose Aphrodite, and when Paris whisked Helen away from her Greek husband, King Menelaus, the Greek armies banded together to besiege Troy and recapture Helen.<i>The Iliad</i> and <i>The Odyssey</i> have given the world some of the most memorable characters in literature; the mighty but temperamental warrior Achilles; Odysseus the crafty storyteller; the wife of Odysseus, faithful Penelope; and the enigmatic beauty, Helen of Troy. The Greek gods are also described in similar ways. Zeus, Athena, Hera, and Apollo all bicker and seduce with as much zest as the human characters, but their ability to determine the fate of human lives gives them power within both the poems and the culture from which they emerged.Many of the themes in Homer&#x2019;s work have become central in Western literature. Achilles&#x2019; choice between the tranquil, domestic life and that of a warrior is part of the larger struggle of choosing between mortal peace and immortal glory. Odysseus survives his decade-long trip home due to his extraordinary storytelling skills, thereby elevating narrative itself to the highest virtue.<br>&nbsp;?Homer The supposedly blind poet Homer is the alleged author of both <i>The Iliad</i> and <i>The Odyssey</i>, along with other ancient writings. Ancient Greeks believed he was the genuine author, but modern scholars are skeptical. No verifiable biographical information is known, but most dates of his birth range from around 950&#x2013;850 B.C. in the region of Ionia, now a part of modern Turkey. This range coincides with the establishment of a Greek alphabet and the introduction of writing in ancient Greece and has been determined by clues within the poems themselves. Homer&#x2019;s epics were meant to be sung, and there is evidence to support the theory that what Homer recorded was the detailed narrative that had been accumulated over several hundred years as the stories became foundational myths within Greek culture. Homer&#x2019;s phraseology and meter, known as dactylic or &#x201c;heroic&#x201d; hexameter, influenced other ancient poets&#x2014;such as Sappho, Callinus, and Tyrtaeus. The 33 &#x201c;Homeric Hymns&#x201d; celebrating Greek deities are named so because they were anonymously written in this form.<br>&nbsp;?<i>The Iliad</i> Homer&#x2019;s epic poem is about the 10-year war between the ancient Greeks and the Trojans, that may have been waged around 1000&#x2013;1100 B.C. The war began when the Greek ariled to Troy to avenge the abduction of Helen, the wife of the Greek king Menelaus, by the Trojan prince Paris. The central figure is the young Greek warrior Achilles, who must choose between death with immortal glory on the battlefield and a long life of domestic tranquility ending in an unremarked death.After nine years of attempting to siege the walled city of Troy, frustration plagues the Greek warriors. Their leader, Agamemnon, angers Achilles, who then withdraws from the battle and threatens to return to his homeland. Menelaus (brother to Agamemnon) decides to engage the Trojan hero Paris in one-on-one combat to determine the war&#x2019;s outcome. Menelaus wins, but the goddess Aphrodite saves Paris, and the war&#x2019;s status appears in doubt. The gods intervene frequently in the Trojan War, with factions and rivalries as rampant on Mount Olympus as among the mortals below. The gods decide that the war must continue, despite Menelaus&#x2019; victory against Paris.Troy&#x2019;s best warrior is Hector, brother of Paris and son of Priam, the Trojan king. As the war continues, Hector prepares himself for battle and shares a tender farewell with his wife, Andromache, and their frightened son, Astyanax. Hector knows that the longer the war lasts the more likely it is he will never return to his family.With the gods agreeing not to interfere, the Greeks begin to lose ground. Odysseus and Ajax beg Achilles to return. He rejects them and their offerings, expressing his hatred for Agamemnon and claiming he would not rejoin the fight unless Hector and the Trojans were at the beaches, about to burn the Greek ships.After Agamemnon is wounded in battle, Hector and his forces fight against the weakened Greeks. The Trojans reach a moat and a wall that the Greeks have built to protect the ships. A portent&#x2014;an eagle flying with a snake in its talons&#x2014;causes hesitation until Hector dismisses its importance. They advance to the seemingly impenetrable wall, and the Trojan hero Sarpedon eventually breaches it, allowing the Trojans to force the Greeks back to the ships.The god Poseidon intervenes on behalf of the Greeks to encourage them to reengage the battle. He succeeds, and Hector and his troops are halted. Meanwhile, Zeus favors the Trojans. However, his wife, Hera, uses all her charms to soothe Zeus into a deep sleep to aid Poseidon&#x2019;s intervention. The deceit is successful, and the Greeks push the Trojans back, wounding Hector in the process. Zeus awakens and is enraged. He berates Hera and has Poseidon abandon his effort; he also has Hera send Apollo to rejuvenate Hector and send him back to battle. The Trojans take control and drive the Greeks back to the ships, which they heroically defend, although they realize the tide of battle has again changed.Still Achilles stays away, but his beloved companion, Patroclus, wishes to fight, and with Achilles&#x2019; blessing dons Achilles&#x2019; famous armor and leads his men to drive the Trojans away from the ships. Patroclus slays Sarpedon, thereby enraging Hector, who leads a charge against the Greeks and kills Patroclus in revenge.Achilles is overwhelmed with grief. His desire to avenge Patroclus sends him back into battle. At an assembly of the army, Achilles and Agamemnon reconcile. The Greek army, Achilles in the lead, takes to the battlefield. With Achilles back in the battle, Zeus assembles the gods and permits them to side with their favorite mortals. Achilles and the Trojan Aeneas (the future founder of Rome) face off, but Poseidon saves Aeneas. Achilles then encounters Hector, and each is saved in turn by Athena and Apollo. Achilles then goes on a bloody rampage through the ranks of the Trojans, forcing the Trojans to retreat to their city walls.Hector alone remains outside to battle Achilles. Priam begs him to reconsider, but Hector insists. Achilles approaches, and fearing for his life, Hector runs around Troy&#x2019;s walls three times as Achilles chases him. They finally fight, and mighty Hector is killed. Achilles ties his feet to a chariot and drags Hector toward the Greek ships as Hector&#x2019;s wife and parents look on in grief.Achilles mourns for Patroclus, whose body is cremated, and elaborate funeral games take place. Priam remains disconsolate without even the comfort of honoring Hector&#x2019;s body. The gods offer a solution: Thetis tells Achilles to accept a ransom for the return of Hector&#x2019;s body, and Iris convinces Priam to approach Achilles with valuable gifts. <i>The Iliad</i> closes with Hector&#x2019;s funeral, signaling impending doom for the city of Troy.<br>&nbsp;?<i>The Odyssey</i> Homer&#x2019;s epic tale covers the period following the Trojan War and recounts the travels of the Greek warrior Odysseus in the 10 years he takes to return to his homeland, Ithaca. As the story begins, it has been seven years since the end of the war, and Odysseus is trapped on the island of the goddess-queen Calypso. Back home in Ithaca, a group of rowdy suitors have gathered to try to win the hand of Odysseus&#x2019;s wife, Penelope. His grown son, Telemachus, is visited by the disguised Athena and advised to dismiss the suitors and seek the whereabouts of his father.Accompanied by the disguised Athena, Telemachus sails to Pylos, home of wise old Nestor, a survivor of the Trojan War, and then to Menelaus and Helen at Sparta. Menelaus tells several tales of the war, including Odysseus&#x2019;s ploy of the Trojan Horse. He also relates Agamemnon&#x2019;s fatal homecoming and the imprisonment of Odysseus by Calypso.Odysseus is still with Calypso, longing to return home. After Athena&#x2019;s intervention, he builds a raft and sets off, but wrathful Poseidon drives Odysseus into the sea. He washes up on the island of the Phaeacians, where he is received as an honored guest. The following day, King Alcinous&#x2019; men prepare a ship for Odysseus&#x2019; return, and a great feast is held in the palace, where Odysseus is asked to recount his adventures.He relates his encounter with the giant one-eyed Cyclops, who devoured several of his men before Odysseus lulled him to sleep with wine. He and his men then gouged out his eye and retreated to their ship. (The Cyclops was Poseidon&#x2019;s son, and his murder is the reason for Poseidon&#x2019;s anger toward Odysseus.) Odysseus tells how he approached Ithaca but was blown back by the winds and landed on the isle of the Laestrygonians, cannibals who killed most of his men. They then landed on Aeaea, the home of the goddess Circe, who turned many of his men into swine and convinced Odysseus to stay with her in luxury. He eventually leaves with instructions from her to visit Hades and consult the seer T...</p><h2>Campbell Biology in Focus, Books a la Carte Edition (2nd Edition)</h2><p>More than 10 million students are using Pearson s MyLab/Mastering! <br>MyLab/Mastering is online personalized learning that improves results.

The book is written accessibly and helpfully and will be invaluable to teachers (like myself) who struggle to make race talk a central part of their work"<br> <b>&#x2014;Stephen Brookfield,</b> John Ireland Endowed Chair, University of St. Thomas, Minneapolis-St. Paul</p> <p>Written by the nation's leading multicultural scholar, this book introduces race talk to anyone with a need to understand the complexities of race in diverse settings. Based on original research, <i>Race Talk and the Conspiracy of Silence</i>, is an eye-opening examination of how our habit of avoiding the topic of race has detrimental consequences for Whites, people of color, and society as a whole.</p> <p>If you believe that talking about race is impolite, or that "colorblindness" is the preferred approach, you must read this book. <i>Race Talk and the Conspiracy of Silence</i> debunks the most pervasive myths using evidence, easy-to-understand examples, and practical tools.</p> <p>This significant work answers all your questions about discussing race by covering:</p> <ul> <li>Characteristics of typical, unproductive conversations on race</li> <li>Tacit and explicit social rules related to talking about racial issues</li> <li>Race-specific difficulties and misconceptions regarding race talk</li> <li>Concrete advice for educators and parents on approaching race in a new way</li> </ul> <p><i>Race Talk and the Conspiracy of Silence</i> has the potential to transform the way you address race in your everyday life. By understanding how conversations on race can impact people for the better, you can break the silence to build better relationships and a more just and equitable society.</p><p>Unspoken social rules determine much of what we say and do at home, at school, and at work with clients and coworkers. Often, these rules are good for society&#x2014;they allow us to get along with one another in the world. But occasionally, these hidden rules have a detrimental impact, and in those situations the rules must be brought to light and eliminated. In avoiding this emotionally charged topic, we usually have good intentions&#x2014;a concern for politeness, a desire not to offend&#x2014;but Dr. Derald Wing Sue's research has shown that we do far more harm than good when we stay silent about race.</p> <p><i>Race Talk and the Conspiracy of Silence</i> is an enlightening account of why we still see race as a taboo discussion topic, how our silence harms us, and what we can do to change uncomfortable conversations into productive dialogs. Educators in K&#x2013;12 and higher education, trainers, mental health and professionals, and parents will appreciate this book's frankness and foundation in scientific evidence.</p> <p>Learning to talk about race is crucial if we hope to achieve the equal society that has long been part of the American mythos. Each one of us, through our everyday interactions with each other and the example we provide for the next generation, can contribute to this hallmark of social justice. In <i>Race Talk and the Conspiracy of Silence</i>, a concrete set of guidelines and solutions for engaging in honest racial dialogue will help educators, parents, and trainers become agents of change by bringing the issue of race to light in a positive manner.</p> <p>The tacit rules surrounding race talk are more numerous than many people suppose. Without knowing it, we use a number of different strategies to evade the topic, often under the premise that we are "colorblind." <i>Race Talk and the Conspiracy of Silence</i> exposes these avoidance strategies as the fallacies they are. Readers will also discover why being polite about race&#x2014;in other words, ignoring the subject&#x2014;is actually harmful to Whites and people of color alike. This book teaches concrete strategies for identifying and breaking bad habits so that we can break the silence on the issue of race and benefit from meaningful race talk.</p></p><h2>More Attention, Less Deficit: Success Strategies for Adults with ADHD</h2><p><p>This is the only book on Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) written in a structure that caters to the tendency for adults with ADHD to jump around. This essential guidebook begins by describing how the ADHD brain processes information and how that leads to typical challenges that people with ADHD experience, as well as why certain strategies are effective and others aren't. This lays the foundation for everything that follows, from getting diagnosed to an overview of the research of how ADHD affects people's lives. A thorough explanation of standard treatment options-including medication, therapy, and coaching-as well as alternative treatments, helps guide adults with ADHD to get the most from their healthcare providers. From there, the book provides an extensive collection of practical strategies to overcome common struggles in the areas of self-esteem, work, relationships, friendships, parenting, and everyday life.

(Reproduced with permission.)</p><h2>Sturtevant: Double Trouble</h2><p>Sturtevant has been repeating the works of her contemporaries since 1964, using some of the most iconic artworks of her generation as a source and catalyst to explore originality and authorship. Beginning with her versions of works by Jasper Johns and Andy Warhol, Sturtevant initially turned the visual logic of Pop art back on itself, probing uncomfortably at the workings of art history in real time. Yet her chameleonlike embrace of other artists' work is also what has allowed her to be largely overlooked in the history of postwar American art. As a woman making versions of the work of better-known male artists, she has passed almost unnoticed through the hierarchies of mid-century modernism and postmodernism, at once absent from these histories while nevertheless articulating their structures. Published to accompany the first retrospective of her work organized by a US museum, this publication presents Sturtevant as an artist who adopts style as her medium to expose aspects of art making, circulation and canonization. Featuring works drawn from all periods of her career and previously unpublished sketches from her archive, it links Sturtevant's earliest repetitions to the video works she has produced since 1998, providing a comprehensive overview of her practice while situating it firmly within postwar American culture.<br><br><b>Sturtevant</b> was born in Lakewood, Ohio, in 1924. She had her first solo show in 1965 at the Bianchini Gallery in New York. Solo exhibitions of her work have since been held at Deichtorhallen, Hamburg (1992), Museum f�r Moderne Kunst, Frankfurt (2004), Mus�e d'Art Moderne, Paris (2010) and Moderna Museet, Stockholm (2012).

Eudora Welty is one of the very few whose great talent has been expressed in both photographs and fiction.</p><p>This book brings together in one volume about 250 representative photographs from the few thousand that she took during the 1930s, '40s, and '50s. Although her camera's view finder compresses much, like the frame in which she conceives her fiction, it finds elements that convey her deep compassion and her artist's sensibilities.</p><p>From the confines of her native Mississippi, these photographs unfold the world of Eudora Welty's art, reaching, extending, and exploring. In the Deep South of Depression times, when she began writing, she discovered the place into which she had been born and which would always be her subject. From here, as these photographs show, she approached and risked the outside world. From rural Mississippi to New Orleans, Charleston, New York City, and Yaddo, and then to Ireland, England, and the Continent, Welty widened her vision and expanded her art. These photographs reveal that both in her fiction and in the pictures she took it has always been in place, in the special qualities of what is local, that she found her impulse. "I was smitten by the identity of place wherever I was," she said in 1989, "from Mississippi on--I still am."</p><p>The legions of appreciators of Welty's photographs see in them the feelings and vision that are the hallmarks of her great literary art in such novels as <i>Losing Battles</i> and <i>The Optimist's Daughter</i>, in her memoir <i>One Writer's Beginnings</i>, and in her volumes of short stories.</p><p>This serves as a definitive book of Welty's photographs, compromising pictures from her personal collection, from the repository of Welty materials at the Mississippi Department of Archives and History, and from <i>One Time, One Place</i>, an album of her Depression-era photographs published in 1971.</p><p>Included are Mississippi scenes and people, emblems of folklife, carnival signs and performers, photographs taken in Charleston; New Orleans; Mexico; New York City; Ireland; Paris; Nice; Italy; Wales; and Saratoga Springs, New York, and a significant group of Welty's portraits of family members and friends.</p></p><p>The radiant world of Eudora Welty&#39;s art is charged by a poignant and familiar beauty, and here in a stunning book of her photographic work is a dazzling record of this writer&#39;s unique and special vision<b>Eudora Welty</b> (1909&#x2013;2001) is the author of many novels and story collections, including the Pulitzer Prize&#x2013;winning novel <i>The Optimist&#x2019;s Daughter</i>, <i>Losing Battles</i>, <i>The Ponder Heart</i>, <i>The Robber Bridegroom</i>, <i>A Curtain of Green and Other Stories</i>, as well as collections of her photographic work <i>Country Churchyards </i>and <i>One Time, One Place: Mississippi in the Depression</i>, both published by University Press of Mississippi.</p><h2>Pride and Prejudice and Zombies: The Deluxe Heirloom Edition (Pride and Prej. and Zombies)</h2><p><b>The&nbsp;<i>New York Times&nbsp;</i>best seller is now a major motion picture starring Lily James and Sam Riley, with Matt Smith, Charles Dance, and Lena Headey.&nbsp;</b><br> &nbsp;<br> <b>This deluxe heirloom edition includes a new preface by coauthor Seth Grahame-Smith, thirteen oil painting illustrations by Roberto Parada, and a fascinating afterword by Dr. Allen Grove of Alfred University&#x2014;plus 30 percent more zombies!</b><br><br>Complete with romance, heartbreak, swordfights, cannibalism, and thousands of rotting corpses,&nbsp;<i>Pride and Prejudice and Zombies</i>&nbsp;is an audacious retelling of English literature&#x2019;s most enduring novel.

Somewhere in the nave of Winchester Cathedral, we imagine that Austen&#x2019;s corpse, though presumably dead, must be rolling.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Provincial English readers understood that their world of genteel gallantry and tea parties was under threat by sweeping social changes and violent revolutionary forces.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Gothic authors frequently reworked existing novels with new and sensational supernatural machinery. And although zombies have been popular only in recent decades, their presence in Pride and Prejudice and Zombies makes explicit what Austen constantly implies: Elizabeth Bennet&#x2019;s world of aristocratic gentility was under attack not just by fortune hunters like Wickham and fortune abusers like Lady Catherine de Bourgh, but also by larger and sometimes more violent and terrifying social and political forces.&#x201d;<br></p><h2>1948: A History of the First Arab-Israeli War</h2><p><p>This history of the foundational war in the Arab-Israeli conflict is groundbreaking, objective, and deeply revisionist. A riveting account of the military engagements, it also focuses on the war's political dimensions. Benny Morris probes the motives and aims of the protagonists on the basis of newly opened Israeli and Western documentation. The Arab side&#x2014;where the archives are still closed&#x2014;is illuminated with the help of intelligence and diplomatic materials.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Morris stresses the <i>jihadi</i> character of the two-stage Arab assault on the Jewish community in Palestine. Throughout, he examines the dialectic between the war's military and political developments and highlights the military impetus in the creation of the refugee problem, which was a by-product of the disintegration of Palestinian Arab society. The book thoroughly investigates the role of the Great Powers&#x2014;Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union&#x2014;in shaping the conflict and its tentative termination in 1949. Morris looks both at high politics and general staff decision-making processes and at the nitty-gritty of combat in the successive battles&nbsp;that&nbsp;resulted in the emergence of the State of Israel and the humiliation of the Arab world, a humiliation that underlies the continued Arab antagonism toward Israel.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></p><p><p>A conversation with Benny Morris</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Q: How does <i>1948: A History of the First Arab-Israeli War</i> relate to your previous work?</p><p>A: In the past, I have written about one particular aspect of the war&#x2014;about the creation of the Palestinian refugee problem over 1947-1949, for example&#x2014;or, more generally, about the course of the Zionist-Arab conflict from 1881 to 2000. In this book I address the whole of the 1948 War in its political and military aspects, taking in as well the international context and interventions, the Arab world, and the internal Israeli scene. I try to present a good overall picture of what happened and why, from the UN handling of the Palestine issue to the Israeli-Arab armistice agreements that ended the war.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Q: What do you think at bottom is the cause of the Arab-Israeli conflict?</p><p>&nbsp;A: I would say that there is a territorial dispute between two peoples who claim the same patch of land. It is a very small, patch of land, and so the idea of dividing it between the two is extremely problematic a the technical sense. But it is also a cultural-religious conflict between the Islamic East and the West. The Islamic Arab world sees Israel&#x2014;as it sees itself&#x2014;as an offshoot and outpost of the West in&#x2014;in their view&#x2014;a Muslim area and as an infidel, invasive presence. Israel and Zionism are seen by the Islamic Arab world, and the wider Islamic world, as illegitimate. This, at root, is the cause of the ongoing conflict. Were they to accord it legitimacy, the problem in Palestine/Israel would be soluble. At present, given this mindset, it isn't.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Q: Are there any lessons to be learned from the study of the 1948 War?</p><p>A: To be sure, many Israelis will learn that they must remain strong and technologically advanced; otherwise they will be overwhelmed by Arab numbers and fervor. The Arabs might learn that they must improve themselves, at least on a technological-scientific level, and better their societies and armies, if they hope to overcome Israel, though it is possible that if they do, they may lose the desire to destroy Israel. Outsiders may simply learn about the conflict and the nature of the two contending societies, at least as they were in 1948, and perhaps with certain implications for the present and future.</p><p>Benny Morris is professor of history in the Middle East Studies Department of Ben-Gurion University, Israel.

Visiting the Louvre&#x2019;s collections of paintings, drawings, sculptures, embroidery and enamel, the artist photographed the flowers that appeared there.

Or is the dashing explorer Shelmerdine the ideal man? And what form will Orlando take on the journey - a nobleman, traveller, writer? Man or... woman?

But who were the early speakers of this ancient mother tongue, and how did they manage to spread it around the globe? Until now their identity has remained a tantalizing mystery to linguists, archaeologists, and even Nazis seeking the roots of the Aryan race. <i>The Horse, the Wheel, and Language</i> lifts the veil that has long shrouded these original Indo-European speakers, and reveals how their domestication of horses and use of the wheel spread language and transformed civilization.</p><br><p> Linking prehistoric archaeological remains with the development of language, David Anthony identifies the prehistoric peoples of central Eurasia's steppe grasslands as the original speakers of Proto-Indo-European, and shows how their innovative use of the ox wagon, horseback riding, and the warrior's chariot turned the Eurasian steppes into a thriving transcontinental corridor of communication, commerce, and cultural exchange. He explains how they spread their traditions and gave rise to important advances in copper mining, warfare, and patron-client political institutions, thereby ushering in an era of vibrant social change. Anthony also describes his fascinating discovery of how the wear from bits on ancient horse teeth reveals the origins of horseback riding.</p><br><br><p> <i>The Horse, the Wheel, and Language</i> solves a puzzle that has vexed scholars for two centuries--the source of the Indo-European languages and English--and recovers a magnificent and influential civilization from the past.</p></p><p><p>"If you want to learn about the early origins of English and related languages, and of many of our familiar customs such as feasting on holidays and exchanging gifts, this book provides a lively and richly informed introduction. Along the way you will learn when and why horses were domesticated, when people first rode horseback, and when and why swift chariots changed the nature of warfare."<b>--Peter S. Wells, author of <i>The Battle that Stopped Rome</i></b></p><p>"A very significant contribution to the field. This book attempts to resolve the longstanding problem of Indo-European origins by providing an examination of the most relevant linguistic issues and a thorough review of the archaeological evidence.

To be fair, she&#x2019;s not really alone. Jimmy is upstairs sleeping. But she feels alone. It&#x2019;s ten in the morning, and the girls are at school, and Jimmy will sleep until at least noon. She&#x2019;s curled up on the couch, sipping hot cocoa from her favorite blue mug, watching the fire in the fireplace, and listening.<br> <br>Rain and sand spray against the windows like an enemy attacking. Wind chimes gong repetitive, raving-mad music, riding gusts from some distant neighbor&#x2019;s yard. The wind howls like a desperately mournful animal. A desperately mournful wild animal. Winter storms on Nantucket are wild. Wild and violent. They used to scare her, but that was years ago when she was new to this place.<br> <br>The radiator hisses. Jimmy snores.<br> <br>She has already done the laundry, the girls won&#x2019;t be home for several hours, and it&#x2019;s too early yet to start dinner. She&#x2019;s grateful she did the grocery shopping yesterday. The whole house needs to be vacuumed, but she&#x2019;ll wait until after Jimmy is up. He didn&#x2019;t get home from work until after 2:00 a.m.<br> <br>She wishes she had the book for next month&#x2019;s book club. She keeps forgetting to stop by the library to check it out. This month&#x2019;s book was The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time by Mark Haddon. It was a quick read, a murder mystery narrated by an autistic teenage boy. She liked it and was especially fascinated by the main character&#x2019;s strange inner world, but she hopes the next one will be a bit lighter. They typically choose more serious literature for book club, but she could use a pleasant escape into a hot summer romance right about now. They all could.<br> <br>A loud bang against the back of the house startles her. Grover, their black Lab, lifts his head from where he&#x2019;s been sleeping on the braided rug.<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s okay, Grove. It&#x2019;s just Daddy&#x2019;s chair.&#x201d;<br> <br>Knowing a big storm was on its way, she told Jimmy to take his chair in last night before he left for work. It&#x2019;s his &#x201c;cigar-smoking&#x201d; chair. One of the summer residents left it on the side of the road in September with a sign taped to it that read FREE, and Jimmy couldn&#x2019;t resist it. The thing is trash. It&#x2019;s a cedar Adirondack chair. In most places on Earth, that chair could weather a lifetime, but on Nantucket, the salty, humid air eventually degrades everything but the densest man-made composite materials. Everything needs to be extraordinarily tough to survive here. And probably more than a little dense.<br> <br>Jimmy&#x2019;s moldy, corroded chair belongs at the dump or at least in the garage, as Beth wisely suggested last night. But instead, the wind has just lifted it off the ground and heaved it against the house. She thinks about getting up and hauling the chair into the garage herself, but then she thinks better of it. Maybe the storm will smash it to pieces. Of course, even if this happens, Jimmy will just find some other chair to sit in while he smokes his smelly cigars.<br> <br>She sits and tries to enjoy her cocoa, the storm, and the fire, but the impulse to get up and do something nags at her. She can&#x2019;t think of anything useful to do. She walks over to the fireplace mantel and picks up the wedding picture of Jimmy and her. Mr. and Mrs. James Ellis. Fourteen years ago. Her hair was longer and blonder then. And her skin was flawless. No pores, no spots, no wrinkles. She touches her thirty-eight-year-old cheek and sighs. Jimmy looks gorgeous. He still does, mostly.<br> <br>She studies his smile in the photo. He has a slight overbite, and his eyeteeth jut forward a touch. When she met him, she thought his imperfect teeth added to his charm, lending just enough to his rugged good looks without making him look like a hillbilly. He has a self-assured, mischievous, full-out grin for a smile, the kind that makes people&#x2014;women&#x2014;put forth considerable effort to be the reason for it.<br> <br>But his teeth have started to bug her. The way he picks at them with his tongue after he eats. The way he chews his food with his mouth open. The way his eyeteeth stick out. She sometimes finds herself staring at them while he talks, wishing he&#x2019;d shut his mouth. They&#x2019;re pearly white in this wedding photograph, but now they&#x2019;re more caramel- than cream-colored, abused by years of daily coffee and those smelly cigars.<br> <br>His once beautiful teeth. Her once beautiful skin. His annoying habits. She has them, too. She knows her nagging drives him crazy. This is what happens when people get older, when they&#x2019;re married for fourteen years. She smiles at Jimmy&#x2019;s smile in the picture, then replaces it on the mantel a little to the left of where it was before. She takes a step back. She purses her lips and eyes the length of the mantel.<br> <br>Their fireplace mantel is a six-foot-long, single piece of driftwood hung over the hearth. They found it washed up on the shore one night on Surfside Beach during that first summer. Jimmy picked it up and said, We&#x2019;re hanging this over the fireplace in our house someday. Then he kissed her, and she believed him. They&#x2019;d only known each other for a few weeks.<br> <br>Three pictures are on the mantel, all in matching weathered, white frames&#x2014;one of Grover when he was six weeks old on the left, Beth and Jimmy in the middle, and a beach portrait of Sophie, Jessica, and Gracie in white shirts and floral, pink peasant skirts on the right. It was taken just after Gracie&#x2019;s second birthday, eight years ago.<br> <br>&#x201c;Where does the time go?&#x201d; she says aloud to Grover.<br> <br>A huge, peach starfish that Sophie found out by Sankaty Lighthouse flanks the Beth-and-Jimmy picture on the left, and a perfect nautilus shell, also huge and without a single chip or crack, flanks the Beth-and-Jimmy picture on the right. Beth found the nautilus shell out on Great Point the year she married Jimmy, and she protected it vigilantly through three moves. She&#x2019;s picked up hundreds of nautilus shells since and has yet to find another one without a flaw. This is always the arrangement on the mantel. Nothing else is allowed there.<br> <br>She adjusts her wedding picture again, slightly to the right, and steps back. There. That&#x2019;s better. Perfectly centered. Everything as it should be.<br> <br>Now what? She&#x2019;s on her feet, feeling energized.<br> <br>&#x201c;Come on, Grover. Let&#x2019;s go get the mail.&#x201d;<br> <br>Outside, she immediately regrets the idea. The wind whips through her heartiest &#x201c;windproof&#x201d; winter coat as if it were a sieve. Chills tumble down her spine, and the cold feels like it&#x2019;s worming its way deep into her bones. The rain is coming at her sideways, slapping her in the face, making it difficult to keep her eyes open enough to see where they&#x2019;re going. Poor Grover, who was warm and happy and asleep a few moments ago, whimpers.<br> <br>&#x201c;Sorry, Grove. We&#x2019;ll be home in a minute.&#x201d;<br> <br>The mailboxes are about a half mile away. Beth&#x2019;s neighborhood is inhabited by a smattering of year-rounders and summer residents, but mostly summer people live on her route to the mail. So this time of year, the houses are empty and dark. There are no lights on in the windows, no smoke billowing from the chimneys, no cars parked in the driveways. Everything is lifeless. And gray. The sky, the earth, the weathered cedar shingles on every empty, dark house, the ocean, which she can&#x2019;t see now but can smell. It&#x2019;s all gray. She never gets used to this. The tedious grayness of winter on Nantucket is enough to unravel the most unshakable sanity. Even the proudest natives, the people who love this island the most, question themselves in March.<br> <br>Why the hell do we live on this godforsaken spit of gray sand?<br> <br>Spring, summer, and fall are different. Spring brings the yellow daffodils, summer brings the Mykonos-blue sky, fall brings the rusty-red cranberry bogs. And they all bring the tourists. Sure, the tourists come with their downsides. But they come. Life! After Christmas Stroll in December, they all leave. They return to mainland America and beyond, to places that have such things as McDonald&#x2019;s and Staples and BJ&#x2019;s and businesses that are open past January. And color. They have color.<br> <br>COLD, WET, AND miserable, she arrives at the row of gray mailboxes lining the side of the road, opens the door to her box, pulls out three pieces of mail, and quickly shoves them inside her coat to protect them from the rain.<br> <br>&#x201c;C&#x2019;mon, Grover. Home!&#x201d;<br> <br>They turn around and begin retracing their route. With the rain and wind pushing behind her now, she&#x2019;s able to look up to see where she&#x2019;s going instead of mostly down at her feet. Ahead of them in the distance, someone is walking toward them. She wonders who it could be.<br> <br>As they get closer, she figures out that the person is a woman. Most of Beth&#x2019;s friends live mid-island. Jill lives in Cisco, which isn&#x2019;t too far from here, but in the other direction, toward the ocean, and this woman is too short to be Jill. She&#x2019;s wearing a hat, a scarf wrapped around her nose and mouth, a parka, and boots. It would be hard to recognize anyone in that getup in this weather, but surely, Beth must know who it is. There are only so many people who would be out walking in this neighborhood in this weather on a Thursday in March. There are no weekenders or day-trippers out for a stroll on Nantucket today.<br> <br>They&#x2019;re a few yards apart now, but Beth still can&#x2019;t identify her. She can only see that the woman&#x2019;s hair is long and black. Beth prepares to say Hello, and she&#x2019;s already smiling when the woman is directly in front of her, but the woman is fixated on the ground, refusing eye contact. So Beth doesn&#x2019;t say Hello, and she feels sheepish for smiling. Grover wanders over for a sniff, but the woman skirts by too quickly and is then behind them before Beth or Grover can learn anything more about her.<br> <br>Still curious after a few steps, Beth looks back over her shoulder and sees the woman at the row of mailboxes, toward the far end.<br> <br>&#x201c;Probably a New Yorker,&#x201d; she mutters as she turns around and presses on toward home.<br> <br>Safe inside, Grover shakes himself, sending water everywhere. She&#x2019;d normally scold him for doing this, but it doesn&#x2019;t matter. Just opening the door splashed a bucket&#x2019;s worth of water into the mudroom. She removes her hat and coat, and the mail falls to the ground. She kicks off her boots. She&#x2019;s soaked through.<br> <br>She peels off her wet socks and jeans, tosses them into the laundry room, and slips into a pair of fleece pajama bottoms and a pair of slippers. Feeling warmer and drier and immediately happier, she returns to the front door to collect the mail from the floor, then walks back to the couch. Grover has returned to the braided rug.<br> <br>The first piece of mail is the heating bill, which will probably be more than their monthly mortgage payment. She decides to open it later. The next is a Victoria&#x2019;s Secret catalog. She ordered one push-up bra three Christmases ago, and they still keep sending her catalogs. She&#x2019;ll toss it into the fire. The last piece of mail is an envelope hand-addressed to her. She opens it. It&#x2019;s a card with a birthday cake pictured on the front.<br> <br>May all your wishes come true.<br> <br>Huh, that&#x2019;s strange, she thinks. Her birthday isn&#x2019;t until October.<br> <br>Inside, the words Happy Birthday have been crossed out with a single, confident ballpoint blue line. Below it, someone has written:<br> <br>I&#x2019;m sleeping with Jimmy.<br> <br>PS. He loves me.<br> <br>It takes her a few seconds to reread it, to make sure she&#x2019;s comprehending the words. She&#x2019;s aware of her heart pounding as she picks up the envelope again. Who sent this? There&#x2019;s no return address, but the postmark is stamped from Nantucket. She doesn&#x2019;t recognize the handwriting. The penmanship is neat and loopy, a woman&#x2019;s. Another woman&#x2019;s.<br> <br>Holding the envelope in one hand and the card in the other, she looks up at the fireplace mantel, at her perfectly centered wedding picture, and swallows. Her mouth has gone dry.<br> <br>She gets up and walks to the fireplace. She slides the iron screen aside. She tosses the Victoria&#x2019;s Secret catalog onto the fire and watches the edges curl and blacken as it burns and turns to gray ash. Gone. Her hands are shaking. She clenches the envelope and card. If she burns them now, she can pretend she never saw them. This never existed.<br> <br>A swirl of unexpected emotion courses through her. She feels fear and fury, panic and humiliation. She feels nauseous, like she&#x2019;s going to be sick. But what she doesn&#x2019;t feel is surprised.<br> <br>She closes the gate. With the card and envelope squeezed in her fist, she marches up the stairs, emphasizing each loud step as she heads toward Jimmy&#x2019;s snoring.</p><h2>Student Lab Notebook: 50 Top Bound Carbonless Duplicate Sets(cover may vary)</h2><p>This latest edition features: <br>50 carbonless duplicate sets sequentially numbered. <br>Fully laminated front and back covers permanently bound at top of notebook. <br>White copy (bottom page) perforated. <br>Current Periodic Table on back cover folds over to prevent bleed through between sets. <br>3-hole punched paper. <br>Features tear-off ruler and general chemistry references. <br>Table of Contents and How to Keep a Laboratory Notebook guidelines included.</p><p>Hayden-McNeil Student Laboratory Research Notebooks are the leading selling duplicating notebooks in the United States and Canada.

There, with only three thousand dollars and a list of names, he was to help those who had fled Nazi Germany and were now trapped in southern France.<br><br>The list he took with him had been prepared by, among others, the Museum of Modern Art and Eleanor Roosevelt. It included most of the premier writers, painters, and scientists of Europe, many of them Jews&#x2014;people like Marc Chagall and Max Ernst, Jacques Lipchitz, Marcel Duchamp, Hannah Arendt, Franz Werfel, Andr� Breton, Andr� Masson, and other sur- realists, and hundreds more. When Fry witnessed their plight, he became determined not just to give them immediate aid but to find ways for them to escape. Slowly he built up a group of people who could help, forging passports and finding secret paths across the Pyrenees into Spain and then to Lisbon. <br><br> Fry himself was constantly in great danger, but he seemed to experience a divine inspiration, achieving greatness and glimpsing immortality by acting as the hero he never thought he could be. His own government tried again and again to stop him and send him home, but he managed to continue his rescue operations for more than a year.<br><br>Only in the past decade has the world begun to honor Fry, who died in 1967. He is, for instance, the only American honored at Israel&#x2019;s Holocaust memorial, Yad Vashem, as one of the &#x201c;Righteous Among the Nations.&#x201d;<br><br>Using letters and records unavailable to anyone else, as well as interviews with numerous survivors, Sheila Isenberg has given us an inspiring story of how the brave and determined actions of one individual can help change the world.</p><p>Choices <p>When Varian Fry arrived in Marseille in August 1940, his mandate was to rescue 200 notable writers and artists whose names had been given to him by Eleanor Roosevelt, Thomas Mann, Albert Einstein, the head of the New School for Social Research Alvin Johnson, and the Museum of Modern Art's director Alfred Barr. </p><p>Those on Fry's list were at risk of being turned over to the Nazis under France's armistice agreement with Germany which included a "surrender on demand" clause. But within hours of his arrival, Fry learned that his list was inaccurate and incomplete. During the months ahead, as he ran a cover operation by day and a rescue operation by night, Fry saved as many endangered men and women as he could. An entire generation of Europeans was at risk: labor leaders, former German politicians, publishers, educators, and political activists -- people whose names he had never heard of. </p><p>Fry had to make hard choices. He chose to rescue those he believed were in the most danger, whose existence was threatening to Hitler because they had written against him, because they were in the underground: Social Democrats; authors and publishers of works critical of Nazism; artists whose works had been labeled "degenerate." </p><p>Fry's efforts sometimes succeeded. Other times, he failed. But he always tried. And we are grateful for every life he saved.</p>&#34;The story of Varian Fry is important on many levels, historical and personal. Skillfully evoking a crucial moment in recent history, Sheila Isenberg tells the compelling and dramatic story of how an ordinary person, thrust into a situation of extreme danger, did extraordinary things for one year in wartime France, then drifted almost lost through the rest of his own life. It is also a story of institutionalized bureaucratic stupidity that must never be forgotten so that it is never repeated.&#34;--Richard Holbrooke</p><h2>The Brothers K</h2><p>Tells the story of the baseball loving Chance family, as they grow up during the 1950s and 1960s</p><p>rade paperback, complementing&nbsp;&nbsp;Bantam's new release of <i>River Teeth</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;and our consistently bestselling edition of&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>The River Why</i>, here is <i>The&nbsp;&nbsp;Brothers K</i>, a lyrical and lovely novel of&nbsp;&nbsp;family."The pages of <i>The Brothers K</i> sparkle!"--<i>The New York Times Book Review</i>.<p>"Duncan is a wonderfully engaging writer."--<i>Los Angeles Times</i>.</p></p><h2>Haldol and Hyacinths: A Bipolar Life</h2><p><b>With candor and humor, a manic-depressive Iranian-American Muslim woman chronicles her experiences with both clinical and cultural bipolarity.</b><p><b>&nbsp;</b></p><p>Melody Moezzi was born to Persian parents at the height of the Islamic Revolution and raised amid a vibrant, loving, and gossipy Iranian diaspora in the American heartland. &nbsp;When at eighteen, she began battling a severe physical illness, her community stepped up, filling her hospital rooms with roses, lilies, and hyacinths.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>But when she attempted suicide and was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, there were no flowers.

I&#x2019;ve never been in constant uncontrollable&nbsp;pain. I&#x2019;ve never lost a child. I&#x2019;ve never killed or irreparably harmed anyone with fewer than six legs. I&#x2019;ve never fought in a war or witnessed a massacre. I&#x2019;ve never <i>irretrievably</i> lost my mind. And I&#x2019;ve never been raped.</p><p>I can&#x2019;t say the same for the bulk of my former companions on the Stillbrook Institute&#x2019;s women&#x2019;s psych unit. If I gained anything from my first inpatient psychiatric stay, it was a deep appreciation for the potential morality of murder. After hearing countless women share their excruciating experiences being tortured and violated, most often as children and by family members, I gained a new appreciation for my legal education. Instead of spending group sessions contemplating my own despair and the pathetic suicide attempt that had landed me in a room full of rape victims, manic-depressives, anorexics, bulimics, schizophrenics, drug addicts and self-mutilators, I spent those sessions contemplating ways to get away with murder. I&#x2019;m confident that no responsible mental health professional would endorse homicidal ideations as an acceptable cure for suicidal ones, but I&#x2019;m equally confident that my budding interest in killing rapists drastically curtailed my interest in killing myself. Nevertheless, I&#x2019;d attempted suicide less than a week before, so I couldn&#x2019;t be trusted. Hence my residence at Stillbrook.</p><p>Despite our differences, my fellow prisoners and I had a great deal in common. We were all seriously ill; we all desperately needed help; and we all resented the fact that we needed it. What&#x2019;s more, we were all acutely aware of the classified nature of our conditions and whereabouts. This wasn&#x2019;t paranoia. It was self-preservation. People tend to look unfavorably upon the mentally ill, especially those of us who&#x2019;ve been hospitalized.</p><p>Losing your mind is indeed traumatizing, but doing so in front of a supposedly sane audience is mortifying. It&#x2019;s not like getting cancer. No one rallies around you or shaves her head in solidarity or brings you sweets. &#x201c;Normals&#x201d; (or &#x201c;normies,&#x201d; as some of us &#x201c;crazies&#x201d; affectionately refer to them) feel uneasy around those of us who&#x2019;ve lost a grip on reality. Perhaps they&#x2019;re afraid we might �attack them or drool on them or, worse yet, suck them into our alternate universe where slitting your wrists and talking to phantoms seem perfectly rational. Lucky for me, my initial audience was limited to my husband, my psychiatrist and a few strangers in the latter&#x2019;s waiting room.</p><p>As an Iranian-American Muslim in the buckle of the Bible Belt at the start of the twenty-first century, I&#x2019;ve been intimately acquainted with stigma, scorn and isolation for quite some time&#x2014;long before and since Stillbrook. But this was different. This stigma was far more suffocating, this scorn more subtle, this isolation more literal. A brutal species of shame set in, so vicious and insidious it easily could have starred in its own series on Animal Planet. <i>Shark Week</i> would pale by comparison.</p><p>I&#x2019;ve never been ashamed of my background, and I&#x2019;ve never tried to hide it. I&#x2019;m proud of where I&#x2019;m from. But I wasn&#x2019;t proud of where I&#x2019;d arrived. There&#x2019;s no pride in being a mental patient. We have no especially loud and high-profile advocates. No Michael J. Foxes, no Christopher Reeves, no Lance Armstrongs. No pink boas or bracelets or ribbons or T-shirts. Silence and humiliation rule our playing fields. While others down performance-enhancing drugs and play on grass or Astroturf, we down antipsychotics and&nbsp;play on quicksand.</p><p>�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�</p><p>I wasn&#x2019;t diagnosed with bipolar disorder, also known as manic depression or manic-depressive illness, until years after leaving Stillbrook. Failing to recognize my propensity for mania, the folks at Stillbrook, like so many before and after them, misdiagnosed me with standard major &#x201c;unipolar&#x201d; depression. I never questioned them.</p><p>With bipolar disorder, it&#x2019;s mildly common to jump from depression to mania after a suicide attempt. I vaulted. My garrulousness, impulsivity, rapid speech and elevated mood, combined with my obsession with instructing the other patients in all matters imaginable, should have set off some serious bipolar alarm bells, but they didn&#x2019;t&#x2014;at least not for any of my health care providers. Conversely, a few of my fellow bipolar patients lacking any formal mental health training or education quickly caught on. When they approached me, suggesting I seemed more manic than depressed, I immediately dismissed them. Telling someone who is manic that she&#x2019;s manic is like telling a dictator that he&#x2019;s a dick. Neither is going to admit it, and both are willing to torture you to prove their points.</p><p>Never having been one for denailing or waterboarding, I tortured my accusers with pity: &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t blame you for trying to recruit me. It&#x2019;s human nature. Misery loves company and all that. But as bad as I feel for y&#x2019;all, I&#x2019;m still nothing like you,&#x201d; I told them. And I believed it.</p><p>In my mind, I was a burgeoning guru, a mystic full of purpose and pristine judgment. In my mind, it had been a lifetime since I&#x2019;d&nbsp;been on suicide watch. In my mind, I was put on that ward by God Himself to guide those broken women, my future disciples, toward the land of enlightenment: the Persian Dalai Lama of Stillbrook.</p><p>In reality, where time and the Divine aren&#x2019;t nearly as foolish or forgiving, I was just another floundering psych patient. Perhaps I would&#x2019;ve taken my comrades&#x2019; diagnosis more seriously had a doctor shared their concerns, but I doubt it. I&#x2019;ve always been exceptionally gifted in the delusion department, and the idea of having bipolar disorder doesn&#x2019;t sit well with my classically bipolar delusions of grandeur. Still, by that point, I&#x2019;d been living with the brilliant highs and debilitating lows of the illness for well over a decade. It was my normal.</p><p>At best, the marriage between mania and depression is a rocky one. At worst, it&#x2019;s lethal. It&#x2019;s just a matter of where your mind is when death approaches: so delusional and ecstatic that it tricks you into believing you can leap tall buildings in a single bound, or so depressed and hopeless that it has you begging gravity to work its morbid magic. This is what the land of manic depression looks like, though the terrain and mode of transport vary considerably from victim to victim. A disproportionately large number of us seek solace in words, art and music.* Others among us pursue more conventional professions, with positions ranging from CEO to media mogul to world leader to drug addict to ad executive to doctor to teacher to engineer to lawyer to invalid to some amalgamation thereof. Studies show that up to half of us attempt suicide at least once in our lives, and twenty percent of us succeed.*</p><p>No one arrives at or departs from insanity in quite the same way. The airports are plentiful and the gates are infinite. But whatever the route, given a certain history and genetic inclination, going crazy is cake. And for me, it&#x2019;s simpler still, for my bipolarity is more than a chronic clinical condition. It&#x2019;s a corollary of birth. A wide variety and combination of variables are responsible for my condition, but genes, history, a dysfunctional gut and&nbsp;perpetual displacement carry by far the most consequence. Though I don&#x2019;t know the exact weight of each variable, I do know that my bipolar identity was born long before any mental malady.</p><p>�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�</p><p>More than any others, three historical events provoked the byzantine geography of my body, brain and being. All transpired before I was born: the 1953 CIA- and MI6-sponsored coup that overthrew the democratically elected prime minister of Iran, Mohammad Mossadegh, who presumptuously tried to nationalize oil so that Iranians might benefit from their own natural resources; the American* and British imperialism that defined my parents&#x2019; generation as a result; and the so-called Islamic Revolution that this imperialism ignited while I was still a fetus. Were it not for these events, I would have grown up, like my parents, inside Iran. Instead, born in Chicago in the spring of 1979, I was guaranteed a dual existence from the start.</p><p>As I grew in utero, a revolution brewed, one that would ultimately end more than twenty-five hundred years of Iranian monarchy. I was less than a month old when, on April 1, 1979, the Islamic Republic of Iran was born. Given the fact that April Fool&#x2019;s Day (or <i>Sizdeh Be-dar</i>)<i> </i>originated in Iran, it&#x2019;s only appropriate that it would also be the day that Ayatollah Khomeini pulled the biggest joke in modern history on the Iranian people&#x2014;convincing them that Iran would never become an oppressive theocracy. Thus, Iranians traded monarchy, tyranny and imperialism for theocracy, tyranny and independence. A mild improvement, but pathetic nonetheless. Independence alone cannot bring about �liberty.</p><p>Despite our closeness in age, the &#x201c;Islamic&#x201d; Republic and I are&nbsp;different signs. I&#x2019;m a Pisces; she&#x2019;s an Aries. As a water sign, I should be able to put out a fire sign, but alas, no such luck. Regardless of my myriad efforts as a writer and activist, along with those of millions of other Iranians, we* have thus far failed to put out this duplicitous fire. Yet another reason to dismiss astrology as the stinking pile of crap it truly is.</p><p>So it was that I was born beside a nascent fire that I&#x2019;d spend years trying to extinguish as an adult. At the time, of course, I had&nbsp;no idea. Nor did I have a clue that just by being born in the United States with distinctly Persian DNA, I was destined for a bipolar identity and p...</p></p><h2>The Penguin Lessons: A True Story</h2><p>*AS HEARD ON BBC RADIO 2 FACT NOT FICTION BOOKCLUB AND READ BY BILL NIGHY ON AUDIO* &#39;I was hoping against hope that the penguin would survive because as of that instant he had a name, and with his name came the beginning of a bond which would last a life-time&#39; Tom Michell is in his roaring twenties: single, free-spirited and seeking adventure. He has a plane ticket to South America, a teaching position in a prestigious Argentine boarding school, and endless summer holidays. He even has a motorbike, Che Guevara style. What he doesn&#39;t need is a pet. What he really doesn&#39;t need is a pet penguin. Set against Argentina&#39;s turbulent years following the collapse of the corrupt Per�nist regime, this is the heart-warming story of Juan Salvador the penguin, rescued by Tom from an oil slick in Uruguay just days before a new term. When the bird refuses to leave Tom&#39;s side, the young teacher has no choice but to smuggle it across the border, through customs, and back to school. Whether it&#39;s as the rugby team&#39;s mascot, the housekeeper&#39;s confidant, the host at Tom&#39;s parties or the most flamboyant swimming coach in world history, Juan Salvador transforms the lives of all he meets - in particular one homesick school boy. And as for Tom, he discovers in Juan Salvador a compadre like no other... The Penguin Lessons is a unique and moving true story which has captured imaginations around the globe - for all those who dreamed as a child they might one day talk to the animals.</p><p>Tom Michell was born and grew up on the rural downs of southern England, where he grew to love animals, birds and plants. After living in Argentina he returned home and settled in Cornwall where he helps with the family business, tends a small plot of what he calls &#39;good Cornish soil&#39; and sings with a local choir. He is an amateur artist and in his spare time he draws and paints subjects from the wildlife around his home, specializing in birds of prey. Tom is an enthusiastic proponent of understanding how humans can live in genuinely sustainable ways. He is married with four grown-up children and three grandchildren.I Pick Up a Penguin<br><br>The seaside resort of Punta del Este can be found at that point on the coast of Uruguay where the great southerly sweep of South America&#x2019;s Atlantic seaboard meets the northern bank of the vast delta of the river Plate, or R�o de la Plata. It lies some sixty miles to the east of the capital, Montevideo, and across the mighty river from Buenos Aires, the capital of the Republic of Argentina. In the 1960s and 1970s Punta del Este was, for the denizens of those two great metropolises, their Nice, Cannes, or St. Tropez. It was the place where the smart set went for summer holidays to escape the city heat, to stay and be seen in luxurious penthouses and apartment blocks facing the sea, and for all I know, they do so still.<br><br>The key to one of those apartments had kindly been lent to me by the Bellamys, friends of mine who, because it was midwinter, were not using it themselves. I was in Uruguay following an extraordinary stay in Paraguay and was making my way back to the Argentine via the gargantuan waterfalls at Iguaz� and then along the coast. After several weeks of exertions and excitements I was content to spend a few days relaxing in quiet out-of-season Punta del Este.<br><br>I had returned to the apartment late in the afternoon on my last day in order to organize my belongings for a very early departure the following morning. My booking for the hydrofoil across the river Plate was for noon, which required that I catch the colectivo, the local bus, from Punta del Este to Montevideo at a quarter to six in the morning. Colectivos were enthusiastically decorated by their drivers with innumerable diverse adornments and good-luck charms, which were supposed to make up for the bald tires, I think.<br><br>Having finished the packing, I cleaned and checked the apartment, then decided to take a final walk by the sea before going out for what would be my last supper at the resort.<br><br>The harbor at Punta del Este, on the western side of the point, was small, sufficient only for a few score fishing boats and pleasure craft, which on that day were rocking gently on their moorings, in harmony with the floating pontoons along which owners could walk to reach their dinghies. Although the harbor is well defended against the Atlantic Ocean to the east, there was little protection from the westerly breeze that was blowing that day.<br><br>The air was full of the cry of gulls, the slap of halyards, and the smell of fish, and this little haven of security basked serenely in the bright winter sunlight. The vibrant colors of the gulls, boats, and houses were shown to their best advantage against the sapphire sea and azure sky. My attention, however, was drawn toward the countless thousands of fish in the cold, crystal-clear water. Swimming in unison, shoals of sprats raced around the harbor, attempting to evade their predators by zigzagging, or by dividing and reuniting every few seconds. I was mesmerized by the scintillating waves of light that pulsed across the water, like an aurora, as the sun reflected off the iridescent bodies of the fish.<br><br>Next to the rusting antiquated fuel pumps marked in gallons, and housed under a corrugated metal roof, a muscle-bound fisherwoman scooped her living from the harbor with a large green net securely tied to a stout bamboo pole. She wore a leather apron, rubber boots, and a satisfied expression, although, I noted, she had bare hands. Her hair was covered with a brown scarf and her face was deeply lined and weathered. Beside her were three wooden casks filled almost to the brim with sprats, which I presumed accounted for her satisfaction. Standing ankle-deep in flapping silver-banded fish, she dropped her net into the water and lifted a fresh catch almost every minute, to the dismay of the gulls, who scolded her noisily. She gave a toothless grin as she shook each new haul into the barrels and picked out the few fish that hadn&#x2019;t fallen from the net, something I realized she couldn&#x2019;t have done wearing gloves. The little black-backed, swallow-tailed gulls, after hovering briefly about ten feet above the sea, dived down, then bobbed up to the surface to sit on the water with sprats glistening like rubber mercury in their beaks. In another flash, the catch was swallowed.<br><br>There were a couple of penguins in the harbor, too, enjoying their share. It was captivating to watch them fly so fast through the water in pursuit of the fish, far more skillfully even than the gulls in the air. Twisting and turning, they tore through the shoals with breathtaking speed and agility, snapping up sprats as the fish scattered before them. Against such a superlative adversary the sprats appeared to be almost defenseless, other, perhaps, than their seemingly limitless numbers. I was only surprised that there weren&#x2019;t more penguins there to feast on such rich and easy pickings.<br><br>I could gladly have watched them for much longer, but as the penguins swam out of view, I turned and walked round the promontory to the eastern side and so on to the next breakwater. Small, white-flecked waves were rolling in from the ocean and breaking on the beach. I had only been strolling along the seashore for ten, maybe fifteen minutes on that beautiful afternoon, reflecting on all my new experiences, the wonderful and awe-inspiring things I had seen and done on holiday, when I caught sight of the first of them: black, unmoving shapes. Initially I was aware of only a few, but as I walked on, they grew in number, until the whole beach appeared to be covered with black lumps in a black carpet. Hundreds of oil-drenched penguins lay dead in the sand, from the high-water mark to the sea, and stretching far away along the shore to the north. Dead penguins, covered in thick, cloying, suffocating oil and tar. The sight was so dreadful, so sickening and depressing, that I could only wonder what future lay ahead for any &#x201c;civilization&#x201d; that could tolerate, let alone perpetrate, such desecration. I understood then why there were so few penguins in the harbor catching sprats, given the abundance of the fish. Evidently only a lucky few had avoided the oil slick.<br><br>Consumed by dark thoughts, I continued my walk above the trail of devastation that covered much of the beach, trying to estimate the number of dead birds. Even if I had been able to calculate how many penguins were on the shore&#x2014;in places heaped on top of each other&#x2014;it was impossible to assess the number of bodies churning in the sea. Each wave that broke piled more birds on top of those already there, while further out every new breaker was sweeping another grim batch of black carcasses toward the shore.<br><br>The beach between the sea and the wall at the side of the road was narrow, possibly only thirty yards at its widest, but the pollution along the beach extended as far as I could see. Clearly thousands of penguins had died in the most horrifying manner while they were making their way north along their ancestral migration routes just as their forebears had done for millions of years.<br><br>I still don&#x2019;t know why I continued to walk along the beach that day. Possibly I needed to understand just how appalling this event was&#x2014;the extent of the damage. I hadn&#x2019;t heard any reports of an oil spill in this part of the world, but in those days regulations regarding the conduct of oil tankers were less stringent and compliance minimal, so occurrences like this were not uncommon. After discharging cargo at their destinations, oil tankers would put to sea again and wash out their tanks while in transit to collect a new consignment.<br><br>It was events such as these that eventually provoked much-needed change. I had little doubt that what I was witnessing on this beach was the inevitable consequence of a hideous collision of cultures. When the instinctive, annual compulsion of seabirds to migrate met a vast, floating oil slick dumped at sea through human thoughtlessness and greed, there was only one possible outcome: the utter and complete annihilation of those penguins. This would have been indescribably ghastly had it been the result of an accident. That it should be the result of deliberate actions taken in the full knowledge of the likely consequences defied any kind of rationalization or acceptance.<br><br>I had been walking briskly, unwilling to focus too closely on the details of the dead creatures, when, out of the corner of my eye, I thought I saw a movement. Not from the churning spume of the surf, but from the stillness on the beach. I stopped and watched. I hadn&#x2019;t been mistaken. One valiant bird was alive, a single surviving soul struggling amidst all that death. It was extraordinary! How could one solitary bird still be living when the oil and tar had so comprehensively overwhelmed the rest?<br><br>Although it was lying on its belly and covered in tar like the other birds, this penguin was moving its wings and holding its head up. It wasn&#x2019;t moving much, but its head and wings were giving little spasmodic jerks. The death throes of a defeated creature, I assumed.<br><br>I watched for a short time. Could I walk on and abandon it to the poisonous oil and the exhausting, suffocating tar that would slowly extinguish its life? I decided that I could not; I had to end its suffering as quickly as possible. So I headed toward it, clearing space under each footfall with as much decency and respect for the dead birds as was possible.<br><br>I had no clear plan of how I was going to administer the coup de gr�ce. In fact, I had no plan at all. But as that solitary penguin, indistinguishable from the thousands of other tar-dripping penguins in all but one respect&#x2014;this one was alive&#x2014;struggled to its feet to face yet another adversary, all thoughts of such violence vanished from my mind. Flapping sticky wings at me and with a darting raptor beak, it stood its ground, ready to fight for its life once more. It was almost knee high!<br><br>I checked my advance and looked again at this penguin&#x2019;s companions. Was I wrong? Were they alive after all? Just resting, recovering? I turned a few bodies over with my toe. No spark of life appeared in any bird apart from this one, nothing to distinguish one dead penguin from the next. Their plumage and throats were choked up with tar, hideously deformed tongues were protruding from their beaks, and their eyes were completely covered with the corrosive filth. The stink of tar alone would have overcome the birds, and I wouldn&#x2019;t have been walking along the beach myself had not the wind been blowing from the west, carrying the stench out to sea.<br><br>Amid all this obscenity there was just this single penguin with an open, red-tongued beak and clear eyes, jet black and sparking with anger. I suddenly felt a surge of hope kindling for this exception. Could this one survive if cleaned? I had to give it a chance, surely. But how would I approach this filthy and aggressive bird? We stood there, eyeing each other suspiciously, evaluating our respective opponents.<br><br>Quickly I scanned the accumulated rubbish along the beach: bits of wood, plastic bottles, crumbling Styrofoam, disintegrating fishing net, all the familiar things found along the high-water mark on almost every beach tainted by our advanced society. I also had a paper bag containing an apple in my pocket. As I moved away, the penguin settled back down on its tummy and shook its bottom, as though getting comfortable again. Hurriedly I gathered some of the flotsam and jetsam that I thought might be of assistance. Now, gladiator-like, I approached my quarry, which immediately reared up to its full height in response to this new threat. Swirling a piece of fishing net, I distracted the penguin and, with the swiftness and bravery of Achilles, dropped the net over its head and pushed it over with the stick. I pinned it down and, with my hand inside the bag (it was no time to be eating apples), grabbed its feet.<br><br>I lifted the furious creature, twisting and turning in its efforts to escape, clear of the beach and away from my body and discovered for the first time how heavy penguins could be.<br><br>And so back to the Bellamys&#x2019; apartment with a flapping ten-pound bird. If my arm were to tire and that vicious beak come within striking distance, it would skewer my leg and smear me with tar. I was apprehensive about hurting it or scaring it to death and I was trying to ensure it didn&#x2019;t suffer at my hands, but I was also concerned about my own well-being during the return journey of a mile or more.<br><br>My mind teemed with half-formed plans as I made the return journey. What was I going to say to anyone who challenged me? Was I allowed to pick up tar-soaked penguins in Uruguay? Most countries in South America at that time were police states, and I wouldn&#x2019;t have been surprised had there been some absurd law forbidding such a rescue.<br><br>At least I should be able to clean the penguin, I decided as I jogged unevenly back along the beach road. I remembered we had used butter to remove tar from beach towels when we were children, and I knew I had some butter in the fridge in the flat, as well as olive oil, margarine, and detergent.<br><br>Carrying the bird at arm&#x2019;s length was exhausting work, and I had to change hands frequently. I was holding it by its feet, but, fearful of causing any further injury to the frantic creature, I kept a finger between its legs in order to gauge the strength of my grip. I was under no illusion: this was not comfortable for the bird. However, we eventually reached our destination without major mishap to either of us. Despite its best endeavors, the penguin had failed to wound me&#x2014;and I hadn&#x2019;t been tempted to finish it off en route.<br><br>My next problem was how to slip by the fearsome concierge, who occupied an office under the stairs. Throughout my stay she had come rushing out, like a savage guard dog, to scrutinize all visitors as they came and went, as though we weren&#x2019;t to be trusted. It was abundantly clear why the building management had engaged the services of this particular individual to ensure that visitors behaved respectably during their stay, so naturally suited was she to the task. But by some curious twist of fate, on the one occasion she might have had real cause for concern, she wasn&#x2019;t there. The coast was clear.<br><br>Magellan Penguins<br><br>The populations of penguin colonies have suffered serious decline in the last forty years, some by as much as 80 percent and more.

Since Hemingway&#39;s personal papers were released in 1979, scholars have examined and debated the changes made to the text before publication. Now this new special restored edition presents the original manuscript as the author prepared it to be published. Featuring a personal foreword by Patrick Hemingway, Ernest&#39;s sole surviving son, and an introduction by the editor and grandson of the author, Sean Hemingway, this new edition also includes a number of unfinished, never-before-published Paris sketches revealing experiences that Hemingway had with his son Jack and his first wife, Hadley. Also included are irreverent portraits of other luminaries, such as F. Scott Fitzgerald and Ford Madox Ford, and insightful recollections of his own early experiments with his craft. Sure to excite critics and readers alike, the restored edition of &#34;A Moveable Feast&#34; brilliantly evokes the exuberant mood of Paris after World War I and the unbridled creativity and unquenchable enthusiasm that Hemingway himself epitomised.</p><p>In the preface to <i>A Moveable Feast</i>, Hemingway remarks casually that "if the reader prefers, this book may be regarded as fiction"--and, indeed, fact or fiction, it doesn't matter, for his slim memoir of Paris in the 1920s is as enchanting as anything made up and has become the stuff of legend. Paris in the '20s! Hemingway and his first wife, Hadley, lived happily on $5 a day and still had money for drinks at the Closerie des Lilas, skiing in the Alps, and fishing trips to Spain. On every corner and at every caf� table, there were the most extraordinary people living wonderful lives and telling fantastic stories. Gertrude Stein invited Hemingway to come every afternoon and sip "fragrant, colorless alcohols" and chat admid her great pictures. He taught Ezra Pound how to box, gossiped with James Joyce, caroused with the fatally insecure Scott Fitzgerald (the acid portraits of him and his wife, Zelda, are notorious). Meanwhile, Hemingway invented a new way of writing based on this simple premise: "All you have to do is write one true sentence. Write the truest sentence you know."<p> Hemingway beautifully captures the fragile magic of a special time and place, and he manages to be nostalgic without hitting any false notes of sentimentality. "This is how Paris was in the early days when we were very poor and very happy," he concludes. Originally published in 1964, three years after his suicide, <i>A Moveable Feast</i> was the first of his posthumous books and remains the best. <i>--David Laskin</i></p>6 1-hour cassettes</p><h2>The Woman Who Went to Bed for a Year</h2><p>&#39;Townsend is such a deft, stylish comedian and tragedian, and this book is funny and heartbreaking in turns&#39; The Pool What happens when a duvet day turns into a duvet year?

Their inspiration was the brave women who kept the home fires burning during World War II.</p><p>Polly Minick began hooking rugs in the 70's - by hook or crook she was determined to accomplish this feat. Being an avid antique collector, she wanted a couple rugs to go with her collections. The rugs she saw at antique shows were not always in great condition, so she decided to make her own. She felt no need for lessons or that this would be a serious undertaking - she just wanted to make the rugs and be done with it. What she found along the way was that making those two rugs look like what she envisioned was going to take a little longer than she anticipated. She also found that she was "hooked" on rug hooking.<br> <br> Since she started making rugs, Polly has garnered praise in articles in: <i>Better Homes and Gardens</i>, <i>Country Home</i>, <i>Coastal Living</i>, <i>Architectural Digest</i>, <i>Colonial Homes</i>, <i>Early American Life</i>, <i>Victoria</i>, <i>Creative Home</i>, <i>American Patchwork and Quilting</i>, <i>Romantic Homes</i>, and <i>Elle Decor</i> <i>The New York Times</i>, <i>Houston Chronicle</i>, <i>George Towner</i>, <i>The Islander</i>, <i>Naples Daily News</i>, and <i>Ann Arbor News</i> have also written of her accomplishments.<br> <br> Polly is a primitive rug hooker and like many other primitive rug hookers, she draws inspiration from what is around her. She is inspired by family, home, country and nature. Her imagery includes stars, flags, hearts and houses. Her patriotic works were inspired when their youngest son Jim received a commission in the United States Marine Corps; he is currently serving our country as a Colonel and recently returned from his second tour in Iraq. Jim's service has also inspired Polly to work diligently for the Semper Fi Injured Marine Fund which she says is "a labor of love."<br> <br> The ambiguity of Polly's motifs and patterns is understandable given her aim to stick to her goal of making her rugs primitive and naive. She describes many of her drawings as "childlike," placing strong emphasis on her respect and appreciation for early-American creations.<br> <br> Polly's enthusiasm for the art has led to national acclaim as a creator of primitive-style rugs and a highly touted guest lecturer. She enjoys traveling the country and meeting with others who also love fiber art. She is proud of the increased interest in this fiber art over the years, and she feels a responsibility for its continued growth.<br> <br> A lifelong needle artist, Laurie Simpson's quilts grace galleries and private collections.

On April 1, the world's great powers came closer to nuclear war than ever before, all because of an obscure island named Fernando Poo. By the time international affairs returned to their normal cold-war level, some wits were calling it the most tasteless April Fool's joke in history. I happen to know all the details about what happened, but I have no idea how to recount them in a manner that will make sense to most readers. For instance, I am not even sure who I am, and my embarrassment on that matter mates me wonder if you will believe anything I reveal. Worse yet, I am at the moment very conscious of a squirrel-in Central Park, just off Sixty-eighth Street, in New York City-that is leaping from one tree to another, and I think that happens on the night of April 23 (or is it the morning of April 24?), but fitting the squirrel together with Fernando Poo is, for the present, beyond my powers. I beg your tolerance. There is nothing I can do to make things any easier for any of us, and you will have to accept being addressed by a disembodied voice just as I accept the compulsion to speak out even though I am painfully aware that I am talking to an invisible, perhaps nonexistent audience. Wise men have regarded the earth as a tragedy, a farce, even an illusionist's trick; but all, if they are truly wise and not merely intellectual rapists, recognize that it is certainly some kind of stage in which we all play roles, most of us being very poorly coached and totally unrehearsed before the curtain rises. Is it too much if I ask, tentatively, that we agree to look upon it as a circus, a touring carnival wandering about the sun for a record season of four billion years and producing new monsters and miracles, hoaxes and bloody mishaps, wonders and blunders, but never quite entertaining the customers well enough to prevent them from leaving, one by one, and returning to their homes for a long and bored winter's sleep under the dust? Then, say, for a while at least, that I have found an identity as ringmaster; but that crown sits uneasily on my head (if I have a head) and I must warn you that the troupe is small for a universe this size and many of us have to double or triple our stints, so you can expect me back in many other guises. Indeed do many things come to pass.<br><br>For instance, right now, I am not at all whimsical or humorous. I am angry. I am in Nairobi, Kenya, and my name is, if you will pardon me, Nkrumah Fubar. My skin is black (does that disturb you? it doesn't me), and I am, like most of you, midway between tribalism and technology; to be more blunt, as a Kikuyu shaman moderately adjusted to city life, I still believe in witchcraft-I haven't, yet, the folly to deny the evidence of my own senses. It is April 3 and Fernando Poo has ruined my sleep for several nights running, so I hope you will forgive me when I admit that my business at the moment is far from edifying and is nothing less than constructing dolls of the rulers of America, Russia, and China. You guessed it: I am going to stick pins in their heads every day for a month; if they won't let me sleep, I won't let them sleep. That is Justice, in a sense.<br><br>In fact, the President of the United States had several severe migraines during the following weeks; but the atheistic rulers of Moscow and Peking were less susceptible to magic. They never reported a twinge. But, wait, here is another performer in our circus, and one of the most intelligent and decent in the lot-his name is unpronounceable, but you can call him Howard and he happens to have been born a dolphin. He's swimming through the ruins of Atlantis and it's April 10 already-time is moving; I'm not sure what Howard sees but it bothers him, and he decides to tell Hagbard Celine all about it. Not that I know, at this point, who Hagbard Celine is. Never mind; watch the waves roll and be glad there isn't much pollution out here yet. Look at the way the golden sun lights each wave with a glint that, curiously, sparkles into a silver sheen; and watch, watch the waves as they roll, so that it is easy to cross five hours of time in one second and find ourselves amid trees and earth, with even a few falling leaves for a touch of poetry before the horror. Where are we? Five hours away, I told you-five hours due west, to be precise, so at the same instant that Howard turns a somersault in Atlantis, Sasparilla Godzilla, a tourist from simcoe, Ontario (she had the misfortune to be born a human<br>being) turns a neat nosedive right here and lands unconscious on the ground. This is the outdoor extension of the Museum of Anthropology in Chapultepec Park, Mexico, D.F., and the other tourists are rather upset about the poor lady's collapse. She later said it was the heat. Much less sophisticated in important matters than Nkrumah Fubar, she didn't care to tell anybody, or even to remind herself, what had really knocked her over. Back in Simcoe, the folks always said Harry Godzilla got a sensible woman when he married Sasparilla, and it is sensible in Canada (or the United States) to hide certain truths. No, at this point I had better not call them truths. Let it stand that she either saw, or imagined she saw, a certain sinister kind of tight grin, or grimace, cross the face of the gigantic statue of Tlaloc, the rain god. Nobody from S'mcoe had ever seen anything like that before; indeed do many things come to pass.<br><br>And, if you think the poor lady was an unusual case, you should examine the records of psychiatrists, both institutional and private, for the rest of the month. Reports of unusual anxieties and religious manias among schizophrenics in mental hospitals skyrocketed; and ordinary men and women walked in off the street to complain about eyes watching them, hooded beings passing through locked rooms, crowned figures giving unintelligible commands, voices that claimed to be God or the Devil, a real witch's brew for sure. But the sane verdict was to attribute all this to the aftermath of the Fernando Poo tragedy.<br><br>The phone rang at 2:30 A.M. the morning of April 24. Numbly, dumbly, mopingly, gropingly, out of the dark, I find and identify a body, a self, a task. "Goodman," I say into the receiver, propped up on one arm, still coming a long way back.<br><br>"Bombing and homicide," he electrically eunuchoid voice in the transmitter tells me. I sleep naked (sorry about that), and Fm putting on my drawers and trousers as I copy the address. East Sixty-eighth Street, near the Council on Foreign Relations. "Moving," I say, hanging up.<br><br>"What? Is?" Rebecca mumbles from the bed. She's naked, too, and that recalls very pleasant memories of a few hours earlier. I suppose some of you will be shocked when I tell you I'm past sixty and she's only twenty-five. It doesn't make it any better that we're married, I know.<br><br>This isn't a bad body, for its age, and seeing Rebecca, most of the sheets thrown aside, reminds me just how good it is. In fact, at this point I don't even remember having been the ringmaster, or what echo I retain is confused with sleep and dream. I kiss her neck, unselfconsciously, for she is my wife and I am her husband, and even if I am an inspector on the Homicide Squad-Homicide North, to be exact-any notions about being a stranger in this body have vanished with my dreams into air. Into thin air.<br><br>"What?" Rebecca repeats, still more asleep than awake,<br><br>"Damned fool radicals again," I say, pulling on my shirt, knowing any answer is as good as another in her half-conscious state.<br><br>"Um," she says, satisfied, and turns over into deep sleep again.<br><br>I washed my face somewhat, tired old man watching me from the mirror, and ran a brush through my hair. Just time enough to think that retirement was only a few years away and to remember a certain hypodermic needle and a day in the Catskills with my first wife, Sandra, back when they at least had clean air up there . . . socks, shoes, tie, fedora . . . and you never stop mourning, as much as I loved Rebecca I never stopped mourning Sandra. Bombing and homicide. What a meshuganah world. Do you remember when you could at least drive in New York at three in the morning without traffic jams? Those days were gone; the trucks that were banned in the daytime were all making their deliveries now. Everybody was supposed to pretend the pollution went away before dawn. Papa used to say, "Saul, Saul, they did it to the Indians and now they're doing it to themselves. Goyische narrs." He left Russia to escape the pogrom of 1905, but I guess he saw a lot before he got out. He seemed like a cynical old man to me then, and I seem like a cynical old man to others now. Is there any pattern or sense in any of it?<br><br>The scene of the blast was one of those old office buildings with Gothic-and-gingerbread styling all over the lobby floor. In the dim light of the hour, it reminded me of the shadowy atmosphere of Charlie Chan in the Wax Museum. And a smell hit my nostrils as soon as I walked in.<br><br>A patrolman lounging inside the door snapped to attention when he recognized me. "Took out the seventeenth floor and part of the eighteenth," he said. "Also a pet shop here on the ground level. Some freak of dynamics. Nothing else is damaged down here, but every fish tank went. That's the smell."<br><br>Barney Muldoon, an old friend with the look and mannerisms of a Hollywood cop, appeared out of the shadows. A tough man, and nowhere as dumb as he liked to pretend, which was why he was head of the Bomb Squad.<br><br>"Your baby, Barney?" I asked casually.<br><br>"Looks that way. Nobody killed. The call went out to you because a clothier's dummy was burned<br>on the eighteenth floor and the first car here thought it was a human body."<br><br>(Wait: George Dorn is screaming ....)<br><br>Saul's face showed no reaction to the answer-but poker players at the Fraternal Order of Police had long ago given up trying to read that inscrutible Talmudic countenance. As Barney Muldoon, I knew how I would feel if I had the chance to drop this case on another department and hurry home to a beautiful bride like Rebecca Goodman. I smiled down at Saul-his height would keep him from appointment to the Force now, but the rules were different when he was young-and I added quietly, 'There might be something in it for you, though."<br><br>The fedora ducked as Saul took out his pipe and started to fill it. All be said was, "Oh?"<br><br>"Right now," I went on, "we're just notifying Missing Persons, but if what I'm afraid of is right, it'll end up on your desk after all."<br><br>He struck a match and started puffing. "Somebody missing at this hour ... might be found among the living in the morning," he said between drags. The match went out, and shadows moved where nobody stirred.<br><br>"And he might not, in this case," Muldoon said. "He's been gone three days now."<br><br>"An Irishman your size can't be any more subtle than an elephant," Saul said wearily. "Stop tantalizing me. What have you got?"<br><br>"The office that was hit," Muldoon explained, obviously happy to share the misery, "was a magazine tailed Confrontation. It's kind of left-of-center, so this was probably a right-wing job and not a left-wing one. But the interesting thing is that we couldn't reach the editor, Joseph Malik, at his home, and when we called one of the associate editors, what do you think he told us? Malik disappeared three days ago. His landlord confirms it. He's been trying to get hold of Malik himself because there's a no pets rule there and the other tenants are complaining about his dogs. So, if a man drops out of sight and then his office gets bombed, I kind of think the matter might come to the attention of the Homicide Department eventually, don't you?"<br><br>Saul grunted. "Might and might not," he said. "I'm going home. I'll check with Missing Persons in the morning, to see what they've got."<br><br>The patrolman spoke up. "You know what bothers me most about this? The Egyptian mouth-breeders."<br><br>"The what?" Saul asked.<br><br>"That pet shop," the patrolman explained, pointing to the other end of the lobby. "I looked over the damage, and they had one of the best collections of rare tropical fish in New York City. Even Egyptian mouth-breeders," He noticed the expressions on the faces of the two detectives and added lamely, "If you don't collect fish, you wouldn't understand. But, believe me, an Egyptian mouth-breeder is pretty hard to get these days, and they're all dead in there."<br><br>"Mouth-breeder?" Muldoon asked incredulously.<br><br>"Yes, you see they keep their young in their mouths for a couple days after birth and they never, never swallow then'. That's one of the great things about collecting fish: you get to appreciate the wonders of nature."<br><br>Muldoon and Saul looked at each other. "It's inspiring," Muldoon said finally, "to have so many college graduates on the Force these days."<br><br>The elevator door opened, and Dan Pricefixer, a redheaded young detective on Muldoon's staff, emerged, carrying a metal box.<br><br>"I think this is important, Barney," he began immediately, with just a nod to Saul. "Damned important. I found it in the rubble, and it bad been blown partly open, so I looked inside."<br><br>"And?" Muldoon prompted.<br><br>"It's the freakiest bunch of interoffice memos I ever set eyes on. Weird as fits on a bishop."<br><br>This is going to be a long night, Saul thought suddenly, with a sinking feeling. A long night, and a heavy case.<br><br>"Want to peek?" Muldoon asked him maliciously.<br><br>"You better find a place to sit down," Pricefixer volunteered. "It'll take you awhile to go through them."<br><br>"Let's use the cafeteria," Saul suggested.<br><br>"You just have no idea," the patrolman repeated. "The value of an Egyptian mouth-breeder."<br><br>"It's rough for all nationalities, man or fish," Muldoon said in one of his rare attempts to emulate Saul's mode of speech. He and Saul turned to the cafeteria, leaving the patrolman looking vaguely distressed.<br><br>His name is James Patrick Hennessy and he's been on the Force three years. He doesn't come back into this story at all. He had a five-year-old retarded son whom he loved helplessly; you see a thousand faces like his on the street every day and never guess how well they are carrying their tragedies and George Darn, who once wanted to shoot him, is still screaming . . . . But Barney and Saul are in the cafeteria. Look around. The transition from the Gothic lobby to this room of laminated functional and glittering plastic colors is, one might say, trippy. Never mind the smell; we're closer to the pet shop here.<br><br>Saul removed his hat and ran a hand through his gray hair pensively, as Muldoon read the first two memos in One quick scan. When they were passed over, he put on his glasses and read more slowly, in his own methodical and thoughtful way. Hold onto your hats. This is what they said:</p><h2>The Daily Bible Devotional: A One-year Journey Through God&#39;s Word in Chronological Order</h2><p><p>F.

Is this self-segregation a problem to address or a coping strategy? Beverly Daniel Tatum, a renowned authority on the psychology of racism, argues that straight talk about our racial identities is essential if we are serious about enabling communication across racial and ethnic divides. These topics have only become more urgent as the national conversation about race is increasingly acrimonious. This fully revised edition is essential reading for anyone seeking to understand the dynamics of race in America.<br><br><b>"An unusually sensitive work about the racial barriers that still divide us in so many areas of life."-Jonathan Kozol<br></b><br><br></p><p>Anyone who&#39;s been to a high school or college has noted how students of the same race seem to stick together. Beverly Daniel Tatum has noticed it too, and she doesn&#39;t think it&#39;s so bad. As she explains in this provocative, though not-altogether-convincing book, these students are in the process of establishing and affirming their racial identity. As Tatum sees it, blacks must secure a racial identity free of negative stereotypes. The challenge to whites, on which she expounds, is to give up the privilege that their skin color affords and to work actively to combat injustice in society.<br>Beverly Daniel Tatum, PhD, is president emerita of Spelman College and in 2014 received the Award for Outstanding Lifetime Contribution to Psychology, the highest honor presented by the American Psychological Association.

When President Dwight D. Eisenhower gave his famous warning about the dangers of the military industrial complex, he never would have dreamed that a company could accumulate the kind of power and influence now wielded by this behemoth company.<p>As a full-service weapons maker, Lockheed Martin receives over 25 billion per year in Pentagon contracts. From aircraft and munitions, to the abysmal Star Wars missile defense program, to the spy satellites that the NSA has used to monitor Americans' phone calls without their knowledge, Lockheed Martin's reaches into all areas of US defense and American life. William Hartung's meticulously researched history follows the company's meteoric growth and explains how this arms industry giant has shaped US foreign policy for decades.</p></p><p><b>William Hartung</b> is the director of the Arms and Security Initiative at the New America Foundation and has written for the <i>New York Times</i>, <i>Washington Post</i>, and <i>Los Angeles Times</i>. He lives in New York City.Corporate clout, military innovation, and political influence make an uneasy mix in this smart and thorough corporate history of Lockheed Martin's emergence as the nation's largest weapons contractor. Hartung (And Weapons for All) traces the company's rise from unimpressive military aircraft manufacturer in WWI through its emergence as a major supplier of fighters and bombers for the Allies in WWII to corporate behemoth and power player in setting American foreign policy. The author explores how deeply Lockheed's tentacles have penetrated American economic and political life, pulling the curtain back on decades of unsavory dealings: Lockheed's decision to sell airplanes to Japan in the late 1930s (they were later converted to military use); reports of widespread bribery of foreign executives and politicians; and vengeful retribution against Pentagon whistleblowers. Hartung reveals how the company's adaptability has helped it survive--and expand--even as its reputation became tarnished, and echoes President Eisenhower's argument that the only way to ensure against "military-industrial" abuses is to have "an alert and engaged citizenry." This book is a fine step in that direction. (Jan.) <br>(c) Copyright PWxyz, LLC.

As compelling today as it was seventy years ago, to read this riveting novel is to live through the defining events leading up to the American Revolutionary War. Fourteen-year-old Johnny Tremain, an apprentice silversmith with a bright future ahead of him, injures his hand in a tragic accident, forcing him to look for other work. In his new job as a horse-boy, riding for the patriotic newspaper, <i>The Boston Observer,</i> and as a messenger for the Sons of Liberty, he encounters John Hancock, Samuel Adams, and Dr. Joseph Warren. Soon Johnny is involved in the pivotal events shaping the American Revolution from the Boston Tea Party to the first shots fired at Lexington. Powerful illustrations by American artist Michael McCurdy bring to life Esther Forbes's quintessential novel of the American Revolution.</p></p><p>This story of a tragically injured young silversmith who ends up hip-deep in the American Revolution is inspiring, exciting, and sad.

Today he is undeniably a part of our nation's history as one of the four surviving Mercury Seven space pioneers. In <em>Leap of Faith,</em> Cooper not only reveals compellingly what went on behind the scenes of the early U.S. space program, but he also takes dead aim at the next millennium of space travel with his strong views on the existence of extraterrestrial intelligence--and even the distinct possibility that we have already had contact.</p><p>During his distinguished military flying career, Cooper was one of the best of the best at Edwards Air Force Base, where the setting of world records for speed, endurance, and altitude was an everyday occurrence. Even before joining this nation's newly formed manned space program, he understood the dangerous nature of new technologies: hanging it over the edge and pushing the envelope, then hauling it back in and doing it again tomorrow.</p><p>"Gordo" Cooper learned to fly with his father at age eight in his hometown of Shawnee, Oklahoma, and soloed by the time he was twelve. As an impressionable boy, he met overnight visitors to the Cooper household, including famous aviators like Amelia Earhart and Wiley Post, which only heightened his desire to take to the skies.</p><p>Ride with Cooper through his adventurous life in the cockpits of planes and spacecraft alike--he was the last American to go into space alone, exactly thirty-five years ago. He flew in Mercury and Gemini, and served as head of flight crew operations for both Apollo and Skylab, America's first orbiting space station. He was also backup command pilot for Apollo X and directed design input changes for the space shuttle program. He was buddies with Gus Grissom, who died in the tragic Apollo I fire at Cape Canaveral, and was close to Wernher von Braun, the German rocket scientist who was responsible for the United States beating Russia into space, and then to the Moon. Through it all, Cooper, a hero who shuns the label, speaks candidly of his defeats as well as his accomplishments. His life is a tapestry of space travel in the twentieth century.</p><p>And beyond. From a source as credible as Gordo Cooper come these claims: He innocently took revealing pictures of the mysterious Area 51 during his Gemini mission and ended up in the White House speaking about it to the president of the United States; he and other military pilots have chased unidentified aircraft in their Jets; and footage of UFOs taken by his film crew was confiscated by the government, all part of the U.S. military's long-time UFO cover-up.</p><p>Buckle yourself in and prepare for a wild ride; <em>Leap of Faith</em> takes you places you have never been before---and with Cooper's firm hand at the controls.</p></p><p>Gordon Cooper is a living legend in aeronautics and space exploration. Now seventy-two, he does deep-sea salvaging and designs aircraft inspired by the UFOs he has observed and studied. A retired USAF colonel, he lives in Los Angeles, California.<br><br><p></p><p>Bruce Henderson has written more than twenty books, including the national bestseller <em>Hero Found</em> and <em>Rescue at Los Ba�os</em>.

At the time I was a thirty-two-year old air force captain with twelve years of service, based at topsecret Edwards Air Force Base in the California desert.</p><p>The best test pilots in the air force were assembled at Edwards, and I had a great job. As a test pilot in the engineering branch, I had the best of both worlds. I saw a project from the design and administrative side as well as from the pilot's seat. I was testing and flying the nation's top new aircraft-hot fighters like the F-102 and F-106, and the secret U-2, a reconnaissance aircraft built like a graceful glider (and not much faster than one) with an unusually long wingspan and lightweight fuselage, that could fly higher than the surface-to-air missiles of the day.</p><p>A day or two before I was due to leave for Washington, I was called into the base commander's office with three other test pilots-including one named Donald "Deke" Slayton-who had received similar orders.</p><p>Our commanding officer, General Marcus F. Cooper (no relation), asked if any of us knew what our orders were about.</p><p>"No, sir," we all replied.</p><p>"No one will tell me anything," the general groused.</p><p>He was a good CO, a lot better than the old-stick-in-the mud general he'd replaced a year earlier. General Cooper remembered what it was like to be a young pilot, and he was very protective of his men as long as we did the job he asked of us.</p><p>I did see in the paper the other day," he went on, "that McDonnell Aircraft has been awarded a contract for the new manned space program that's starting up."</p><p>My ears perked up. I knew nothing about any "manned space program."</p><p>"Gentlemen," General Cooper said with authority, "if this has anything to do with flying in space, I want you to be <i>very careful</i> what you volunteer for. I don't want my best pilots to be involved in some idiotic program."</p><p>It had been a little over a year since that historic day in October 1957 when the Russians launched Sputnik, the world's first manmade satellite. The 184-pound satellite-about the size of a basketball-could be heard by American tracking stations as it orbited Earth making a characteristic "beep-beep" sound. Residents of neighborhoods across the country waited anxiously in their yards and streets, peering into the sky at a fastmoving speck of light that was surprisingly easy to see.</p><p>I had realized that Sputnik stood to open up a whole new era, and that the Soviet Union had the potential for being one up on us militarily. It reasoned that people and events on Earth could one day be observed from space. When that happened, there would be nowhere to hide.</p><p>Two months later, the U.S. Navy attempted to launch the first American satellite. It was also the first nationally televised rocket launch. Upon completion of the countdown, the Vanguard rocket lifted less than a foot off the ground before the first stage, loaded to the gills with fuel, exploded. The rest of the rocket sank in slow motion toward the ground, embedding itself in the sand next to the launch platform like a bumed-out firecracker. It left an indelible image of America's opening bid in the space race.</p><i><p>Were they now actually thinking of strapping a man onto a rocket?</p></i><p>Unbeknownst to any of us, qualifications for prospective astronaut-pilots had been established by NASA, the newly founded civilian agency designated to lead America's efforts in space, which had received funding from Congress only after Sputnik. Although the United States did not yet have the spacecraft and other hardware necessary to send a man into space, NASA came up with a list of specific requirements to describe the kind of space pilots it was seeking.</p><p>It was believed that they needed to be in their physical prime while possessing a degree of maturity to handle difficult situations. Maximum age was set at forty. Maximum height was five feet, eleven inches, an arbitrary cutoff that eliminated any number of otherwise well-qualified pilots. The spacecraft already on the drawing board had its dimensions dictated by the diameter of the available boosters--the Redstone and Atlas missiles--that would launch it into space. Those dimensions were seventy-four inches wide at the base, and it was determined that once a pilot had on helmet and pressure suit and was strapped in for liftoff, anyone six feet or taller wouldn't be able to squeeze inside.</p><p>The weight limit was set at 180 pounds for two reasons. The first had to do with the finite (and limited) payload of the available boosters-the more a man weighed, the less room there would be for the equipment that would be necessary for a safe and successful mission. Just as important was the belief that anyone who met the height requirement but weighed more than 180 pounds would probably be overweight and therefore have a less than optimal metabolic and circulatory system to handle the stresses of prolonged weightlessness and rapid changes in temperature.</p><p>The search for candidates narrowed to the ranks of practicing test pilots--meaning pilots from the air force, navy, and marines, along with a handful of civilians. The theory was that test pilots had the instincts and training required to handle a complex spacecraft traveling at high speeds and high altitudes. It made sense that the same men who were testing our country's hottest jets should be in the driver's seat when it came time to launch a manned space vehicle.</p></p><h2>Getting Funded The Complete Guide to Writing Grant Proposals</h2><p>The latest edition of the national best-selling textbook on grant writing.

It begins in the tiny Greenwich Village caf� where Smith goes every morning for black coffee, ruminates on the world as it is and the world as it was, and writes in her notebook. We then travel, through prose that shifts fluidly between dreams and reality, past and present, across a landscape of creative aspirations and inspirations: from Frida Kahlo's Casa Azul in Mexico, to a meeting of an Arctic explorer's society in Berlin; from the ramshackle seaside bungalow in New York's Far Rockaway that Smith buys just before Hurricane Sandy hits, to the graves of Genet, Plath, Rimbaud and Mishima. Woven throughout are reflections on the writer's craft and on artistic creation, alongside signature memories, including of her life in Michigan with her husband, guitarist Fred Sonic Smith, whose untimely death was an irremediable loss. For it is loss, as well as the consolation we might salvage from it, that lies at the heart of this exquisitely told memoir, one augmented by stunning black-and-white Polaroids taken by Smith herself. <i>M Train</i> is a meditation on endings and on beginnings: a poetic tour de force by one of the most brilliant, multi-platform artists at work today.</p><p>PATTI SMITH is the author of <i>Just Kids</i>, which won the National Book Award in 2010, and of five collections of poetry. Her seminal album, <i>Horses</i>, has been hailed as one of the top 100 albums of all time. In 2005, the French Ministry of Culture awarded Smith the title of Commandeur des Arts et des Lettres; she was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2007.I believe in movement. I believe in that lighthearted balloon, the world. I believe in midnight and the hour of noon. But what else do I believe in? Sometimes everything. Some- times nothing. It fluctuates like light flitting over a pond. I believe in life, which one day each of us shall lose. When we are young we think we won&#x2019;t, that we are different. As a child I thought I would never grow up, that I could will it so. And then I realized, quite recently, that I had crossed some line, unconsciously cloaked in the truth of my chronology. How did we get so damn old? I say to my joints, my iron-colored hair. Now I am older than my love, my departed friends. Perhaps I will live so long that the New York Public Library will be obliged to hand over the walking stick of Virginia Woolf. I would cherish it for her, and the stones in her pocket. But I would also keep on living, refusing to surrender my pen.</p><h2>Topaz Moon: Chiura Obata&#39;s Art of the Internment</h2><p>Chiura Obata was one of more than 100,000 Japanese Americans forcefully relocated from their homes, work, and communities to the stark barracks of desert internment camps during World War II.

There was no corpse, no witnesses, no evidence. But her uncle, Henrik, is convinced that she was murdered by someone from her own deeply dysfunctional family. Disgraced journalist Mikael Blomkvist is hired to investigate, but he quickly finds himself in over his head. He hires a competent assistant: the gifted and conscience-free computer specialist Lisbeth Salander, and the two unravel a dark and appalling family history. But the Vangers are a secretive clan, and Blomkvist and Salander are about to find out just how far they are prepared to go to protect themselves.</p><p><strong>Amazon Best of the Month, September 2008</strong>: Once you start <em>The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo</em>, there's no turning back. This debut thriller--the first in a trilogy from the late Stieg Larsson--is a serious page-turner rivaling the best of Charlie Huston and Michael Connelly. Mikael Blomkvist, a once-respected financial journalist, watches his professional life rapidly crumble around him. Prospects appear bleak until an unexpected (and unsettling) offer to resurrect his name is extended by an old-school titan of Swedish industry. The catch--and there's always a catch--is that Blomkvist must first spend a year researching a mysterious disappearance that has remained unsolved for nearly four decades. With few other options, he accepts and enlists the help of investigator Lisbeth Salander, a misunderstood genius with a cache of authority issues. Little is as it seems in Larsson's novel, but there is at least one constant: you really <em>don't</em> want to mess with the girl with the dragon tattoo. --<em>Dave Callanan</em><br><br><b>Stieg Larsson</b> (1954-2004) was the Editor-in-Chief of the magazine Expo from 1999, and had previously worked at a major news agency for many years.

Kings were murdered and deposed. Armies marched on London. Old noble names were ruined while rising dynasties seized power and lands. The war between the royal House of Lancaster and York, the longest and most complex in British history, profoundly altered the course of the monarchy. In The Wars of the Roses, Alison Weir reconstructs this conflict with the same dramatic flair and impeccable research that she brought to her highly praised The Princes in the Tower.<br><br>The first battle erupted in 1455, but the roots of the conflict reached back to the dawn of the fifteenth century, when the corrupt, hedonistic Richard II was sadistically murdered, and Henry IV, the first Lancastrian king, seized England's throne. Both Henry IV and his son, the cold warrior Henry V, ruled England ably, if not always wisely--but Henry VI proved a disaster, both for his dynasty and his kingdom. Only nine months old when his father's sudden death made him king, Henry VI became a tormented and pathetic figure, weak, sexually inept, and prey to fits of insanity. The factional fighting that plagued his reign escalated into bloody war when Richard Plantagenet, Duke of York, laid claim to the throne that was rightfully his--and backed up his claim with armed might.<br><br>Alison Weir brings brilliantly to life both the war itself and the historic figures who fought it on the great stage of England. Here are the queens who changed history through their actions--the chic, unconventional Katherine of Valois, Henry V's queen; the ruthless, social-climbing Elizabeth Wydville; and, most crucially, Margaret of Anjou, a far tougher and more powerful character than her husband,, Henry VI, and a central figure in the Wars of the Roses.<br><br>Here, too, are the nobles who carried the conflict down through the generations--the Beauforts, the bastard descendants of John of Gaunt, Richard Neville, Earl of Warwick, known to his contemporaries as "the Kingmaker"; and the Yorkist King, Edward IV, a ruthless charmer who pledged his life to cause the downfall of the House of Lancaster.<br><br>The Wars of the Roses is history at its very best--swift and compelling, rich in character, pageantry, and drama, and vivid in its re-creation of an astonishing, dangerous, and often grim period of history. Alison Weir, one of the foremost authorities on the British royal family, demonstrates here that she is also one of the most dazzling stylists writing history today.</p><p>Lancaster and York.

The Germans and Spanish took notice when in 1479 Archduke Maximilian and his victorious Flemish infantrymen used their long pikes to prevent the mounted French knights from charging. The era of modern warmaking was at hand. <p>In this last volume of his classic history of the art of war, Hans Delbr�ck considers new developments: the use of gunpowder, the invention of firearms, and the employment of noisy large cannon that shot stone and, later, iron balls. After reviewing the establishment of a European infantry, Delbr�ck discusses the transformation of loose confederations of knights into cavalry (well developed by the last Huguenot wars), the organization of fighting mercenaries (followed by wives and prostitutes), and the changing of mercenary bands into standing armies.</p><p><i>The Dawn of Modern Warfare</i> is colored by larger-than-life personalities: Niccolo Machiavelli, the theoretician of the new art of war; Maurice of Orange, renovator of the art of drill and father of military discipline; Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden, perfecter of infantry tactics; Oliver Cromwell of England, reorganizer of a citizen militia into a professional army; and Frederick the Great and Napoleon Bonaparte, military strategists par excellence.</p></p><p>From the eighth century through the Middle Ages feudalism determined the nature of European warfare. Medieval Warfare begins in the time of Charlemagne, who maintained a military system of freemen and of vassals bound to him in service for lands granted in fief. These pages are crowded with re-creations of famous events like the Battle of Hastings and movements like the Crusades; with the brightest flowers of knighthood, and with the mercenary grandeur of Byzantium.As he did in the previous three volumes, all available as Bison Books, Hans Delbr�ck analyzes many famous battles.

She recounts stories passed down to her about the horrors of the Bolshevik Revolution and probes the daily deprivations and small joys of her family's bunkerlike existence.

Ivanovo</i></b></b> <br><br>I WISH MY MOTHER HAD come from Leningrad, from the world of Pushkin and the tsars, of granite embankments and lace ironwork, of pearly domes buttressing the low sky. Leningrad&#x2019;s sophistication would have infected her the moment she drew her first breath, and all the curved fa�ades and stately bridges, marinated for more than two centuries in the city&#x2019;s wet, salty air, would have left a permanent mark of refinement on her soul.<br> <br>But she didn&#x2019;t. She came from the provincial town of Ivanovo in central Russia, where chickens lived in the kitchen and a pig squatted under the stairs, where streets were unpaved and houses made from wood. She came from where they lick plates.<br> <br>Born three years before Russia turned into the Soviet Union, my mother became a mirror image of my motherland: overbearing, protective, difficult to leave. Our house was the seat of the <i>politburo</i>, my mother its permanent chairman. She presided in our kitchen over a pot of borsch, a ladle in her hand, ordering us to eat in the same voice that made her anatomy students quiver. A survivor of the famine, Stalin&#x2019;s terror, and the Great Patriotic War, she controlled and protected, ferociously. What had happened to her was not going to happen to us. She sheltered us from dangers, experience, and life itself by a tight embrace that left us innocent and gasping for air.<br> <br>She commandeered trips to our crumbling dacha&#x2014;under the Baltic clouds, spitting rain&#x2014;to plant, weed, pick, and preserve for the winter whatever grew under the rare sun that never rose above the neighbor&#x2019;s pigsty. During brief northern summers we sloshed through a swamp to the shallow waters of the Gulf of Finland, warm and yellow as weak tea; we scooped mushrooms out of the forest moss and hung them on thread over the stove to dry for the winter. My mother planned, directed, and took charge, lugging buckets of water to beds of cucumbers and dill, elbowing in lines for sugar to preserve the fruit we&#x2019;d need to treat winter colds. When September came, we were back in the city, rooting in the cupboard for gooseberry jam to cure my cough or black currant syrup to lower my father&#x2019;s blood pressure. We were back to the presidium speeches and winter coats padded with wool and preparations for more April digging.<br> <br>Maybe if I hadn&#x2019;t spent every spring Sunday ankle-deep in cold, soggy dirt, I wouldn&#x2019;t have been so easily seduced by the decadent sound of the English language that poured from the grooves of a record called <i>Audio-Lingual Drills</i>, my tutor&#x2019;s pride. I might have gone to medical school, like my mother, or engineering school, like everyone else. I might have even married a Russian.<br> <br>Maybe if I could have attached the word &#x201c;intelligentsia&#x201d; to her weighty figure in a polyester dress made by the &#x201c;Bolshevik Woman&#x201d; factory, I wouldn&#x2019;t have had to escape to America on an Aeroflot flight, a startled face gazing from the passport in my hand, a ravaged suitcase on the KGB inspector&#x2019;s table packed with twenty kilograms of what used to be my life.<br> <br>MY GRANDFATHER, KONSTANTIN IVANOVICH Kuzminov, was a peasant. The countess who owned his village on the steep bank of the Volga five hundred versts from Moscow, feeling guilty for the centuries of serfdom, provided him with a scholarship to attend engineering school. My grandmother was the daughter of a factory owner in the textile town of Ivanovo, who employed most of the men in the village. They married two years before World War I broke out and five years before the Bolsheviks stormed the Winter Palace and the country exploded into civil war.<br> <br>By 1918, when the altruistic countess, among throngs of panicked nobility, sailed from the Crimea toward Turkey, my grandparents already had three children, my mother and her two younger brothers. The revolution, with its promise of liberation from the yoke of absolutism and paradise for all working people, seemed to offer the hope that Russia was on the mend, that centuries of inequality and slave labor were finally over and peace and prosperity almost within reach. But in 1920 food rations shrank yet again and the pall of famine settled over the country, a dawn to the six decades of terror already bleeding on the horizon.<br> <br>That was when my grandmother invented the crumb game. At six and five years of age, my mother and her brother Sima were old enough to ignore their growling stomachs and make do with nothing but a piece of black bread and a cube of sugar, but three-year-old Yuva, my uncle who would die during the first minutes of the blitzkrieg in 1941, clenched his fists and bawled from hunger.<br> <br>&#x201c;Look at how much you&#x2019;ve got,&#x201d; my grandmother would say as she broke a piece of bread and a square of sugar into crumbs with her fingers. &#x201c;A whole mountain of crumbs.&#x201d; My mother and Sima, older and wiser, would exchange a secret look of pity for their baby brother, who allowed himself to be so easily fooled. &#x201c;Two mountains,&#x201d; my grandmother would say. Yuva would stop wailing and rub the snot over his cheeks, pacified by this semblance of abundance, two whole mountains, more bread and sugar than the one sad little square on everyone else&#x2019;s plate, enough crumbs to pick at for a whole hour, to stick into his mouth one by one, plentiful and sweet.<br> <br>By 1928 they lived in a two-story wooden house&#x2014;my grandparents, their one daughter and now three sons, and Baba Manya, my grandmother&#x2019;s spinster sister, resourceful, doughy, and kind. She resewed old clothes for the children who grew too fast, kept three chicks in the kitchen until they were eaten by a cat, and later, during another famine, after World War II, bought the last rickety piglet off a horse-drawn cart that had stopped for a few minutes on their street. The pig lived under the stairs and saved them all from starvation the following year.<br> <br>In 1929 my mother&#x2019;s younger sister, Muza, was born, the fifth and last child. &#x201c;God gave us another girl,&#x201d; announced Baba Manya from the porch where she stood in the breath of Indian summer, wiping her hands on an apron. &#x201c;Praise the Trinity in Heaven, in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.&#x201d; She didn&#x2019;t know that a decree had come down from Moscow declaring religion dead&#x2014;a sickly, fainthearted enemy kicked and stabbed and finally stuffed into the attic of the tsarist past.<br> <br>&#x201c;Not God,&#x201d; protested my fifteen-year-old mother, flanked by her three younger brothers, standing knee-deep in clumps of dandelions, watching as my grandmother swaddled a flailing Muza, who was rapidly disappearing under layers of old sheets. &#x201c;Our mama gave us another girl.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;May your tongues fall off, all of you, godless fooligans!&#x201d; yelled Baba Manya, hurriedly crossing herself. She meant to say &#x201c;hooligans&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>hooligani</i>&#x2014;but she either couldn&#x2019;t pronounce the <i>h</i> sound or didn&#x2019;t know the right word. That&#x2019;s what they all became, my mother and her three brothers&#x2014;fooligans, ardent and na�ve, resolute and reckless, inspired by a new god, a crossbreed of hooligans and fools.<br> <br>IN 1931 MY SEVENTEEN-YEAR-OLD mother, who had inherited my grandfather&#x2019;s obstinacy and revolutionary fervor, pinned up her dark braids in hope of looking older and went to her first lecture at the Ivanovo medical school. Universities were now free, but candidates were accepted on the basis of their social class and not their merit: children of workers and peasants first, children of professionals last. Because my grandfather was no longer a peasant, my mother had to wait two months until a milkmaid&#x2019;s daughter dropped out, creating an opening. In November, when rain washed over the dust covering Ivanovo&#x2019;s roads and turned the town into lanes of mud, she became part of the first motley class of Soviet doctors, trained in the laboratory of the new state to be flung from their classrooms into the caldron of war.<br> <br>In her first year of medical school she was taught by the novel &#x201c;brigade&#x201d; method: one student, the brigadier, took exams for the entire group of twenty. My mother pitied gangly Igor, who stood sweating in front of her class, craning his skinny neck over a textbook to read page after page in his monotonous voice, something about molecules and cells, a biology chapter he would be tested on at the end of the week. The test would either give credit to everyone in the group, now busy talking, daydreaming, and dozing off, or doom the whole lot to failure. Diligent and boring, Igor always passed.<br> <br>By the second year, the brigade method was replaced with individual learning. A professor of anatomy arrived all the way from Moscow and promptly issued a failing grade to a former tractor driver. The days of dozing and daydreaming were over.<br> <br>For the first time at the Medical Institute, my mother opened a textbook and by sheer force of will memorized the name of every bone, vein, muscle, tissue, tendon, and joint. She passed the anatomy final. She passed the surgery internship and the most serious exam of all, in scientific communism, a course hastily spun from quotes of Marx, Engels, and Lenin, a requirement for graduation in every university of the Soviet Union, across all its eleven time zones.<br> <br>Three months after graduation, my mother was the chief and only physician of a fifteen-bed rural hospital thirty kilometers from Ivanovo, near a factory that produced bricks of peat mined from the nearby underground swamps. Brimming with energy and the enthusiasm of the first socialist generation, she was eager to make things better. It was 1937, the twentieth year of Soviet power, the busiest year of the Gulag camps. It was the twenty-third year of my mother&#x2019;s life&#x2014;when, for the first time, she left her parents&#x2019; home, when her future rose on the horizon like the huge crimson sun over the swamp outside her new apartment window.<br> <br>She set up a trauma point where she bandaged victims of accidents, mostly work-related: severed fingers, broken arms, bruised backs and shoulders. But she knew she could do more. Although most of the factory workers were women, there was no maternity ward in the hospital. To give birth, women had to take a horse-drawn carriage to a district hospital eight kilometers away, a long ride on a road often buried under snow or washed out by rain. There had already been two babies born en route, one of whom did not survive the trip. She made a call to the local health department and was told that maternity wards were not a top priority at a time when epidemics of typhus and tuberculosis were mowing down entire towns.<br> <br>Indignant at such a lack of insight on the part of the local authorities, my mother sat down and wrote a letter to the real leader. General Secretary, Moscow, the Kremlin. &#x201c;Dear Comrade Stalin,&#x201d; she began. &#x201c;The patients at my hospital have no place to give birth to our new citizens. The Soviet women, who toil in peat swamps for our common bright future, deserve better.&#x201d; She stopped to consider how to word her request so that in one simple, effective sentence she would cut through the necessary layers of steel to what she knew was the leader&#x2019;s compassionate heart. &#x201c;My apartment can easily be turned into a maternity ward with the help of a few necessary pieces of equipment (list attached). Please help.&#x201d;<br> <br>She thought of the best way to sign the letter, vacillating from &#x201c;comrade&#x201d; to &#x201c;citizen&#x201d; to &#x201c;physician.&#x201d; Comrade seemed too self-promoting: how could she be a comrade to the legend? Citizen was too impersonal. She finally chose her professional title, which still sounded strange, Dr. Galina Kuzminova.<br> <br>The letter, she knew, was a gamble. Only months earlier, when she was living in the Ivanovo apartment with her parents, her siblings, and her uncle, there had been a knock on the door in the middle of the night. It was a loud, demanding knock, the kind that came only at two or three in the morning, the kind that everyone recognized even if they&#x2019;d never heard it before. Two men in black coats marched straight to the room where her uncle Volya lived with his wife and fifteen-year-old daughter, turned the mattresses and all the drawers upside down, and announced that Uncle Volya was under arrest.<br> <br>&#x201c;For what?&#x201d; asked Aunt Lilya in a ragged voice.<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ll find out,&#x201d; muttered one of the men.<br> <br>Uncle Volya stood in the middle of the room, in silly flannel pajamas, trying to quell an asthma attack. His round shoulders were slouched forward, and his mouth gasped for breath as he mopped his forehead with a handkerchief. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s all a mistake, a misunderstanding,&#x201d; he whispered as soon as he could muster enough air, the handkerchief in his hand quivering. The men ordered him to put on a coat and escorted him to a van known as a <i>voronok</i>, or black raven, parked in front of their house. Weeks later Aunt Lilya learned that as part of his job in a propaganda agency, he&#x2019;d taken a stranger from Moscow to a restaurant. There, sitting next to a good citizen dispatched by the NKVD&#x2014;the People&#x2019;s Commissariat for Internal Affairs&#x2014;to listen to conversations with strangers, Uncle Volya told a joke.<br> <br>It wasn&#x2019;t even a political joke. <i>Two militiamen are invited to Comrade Kozlov&#x2019;s birthday party. What should we give him? asks one. The best gift is a book, says the other. No, says the first militiaman. Comrade Kozlov already has a book</i>.<br> <br>They had all heard this joke before, but now it sounded unfunny and flat. Why did Uncle Volya even bother telling such a bad joke? My mother knew he should have been more careful around strangers. Pasted all over town were posters of a woman in a red head kerchief with a finger across her lips and a caption <i>ne boltai</i> in big red letters: do not babble. Babbling was only one step away from treason. Still, she believed that the NKVD had made a mistake. How could Comrade Stalin possibly have arrested an innocent man, her meek and soft-jowled Uncle Volya? Everyone knew that Comrade Stalin wanted everyone to have a good life, whether they were peasants or professors.<br> <br>Yet there it was still fresh in her memory, the image of her uncle&#x2019;s trembling handkerchief and his arm missing the sleeve of his coat as the two men yanked all ten volumes of his collected works of Chekhov off the shelf, shaking them open, tossing them on the floor, angry that they could find nothing inside.<br> <br>My mother also thought of my grandfather, who, in 1921, according to family lore, had telegraphed Lenin when a train full of wheat brought for the starving people of Ivanovo had been detained by a squadron of Red Army soldiers with shotguns. A few hours later, as the story went, the train was allowed to pass, thanks to her father&#x2019;s telegram.<br> <br>In her mind, the scene of Uncle Volya being led away into the black <i>voronok</i> for telling a joke wrestled for a few minutes with the happy image of the Ivanovo citizens saved from starvation by a telegram. She stubbornly decided to believe that Stalin did not know of this obvious injustice, that it all happened as the result of an un-Soviet struggle for power among his crooked underlings.<br> <br>But now she was writing directly to Stalin, the country&#x2019;s conscience and revolutionary glory. My mother signed the letter, folded it in quarters, and gave the envelope to Fyodor, who tended to the hospital horse Verochka and every other day drove the buggy eight kilometers to the nearest town.<br> <br>A few weeks later, when routine traumas and illnesses had focused her attention away from the letter addressed to the Kremlin, she was called to the office of the head of the district health department. Comrade Palkin sat behind a desk, decked out in a military uniform like Stalin and thin-framed round glasses like the head of the NKVD, Beria. His head was small and bald, with wisps of down over the ears, and his thick forearms, which looked like they belonged to a b...</p><h2>Remains of the Day, The (Faber Classics)</h2><p>An elderly butler is on a five-day motoring trip through the West Country in the 1950s.

Visit his website at www.haroldholzer.com.<b>Preface to the Paperback Edition</b><p>More than nine hundred people filled the Great Hall of Cooper Union in New York to hear Abraham Lincoln's great speech that night, many waiting hours on a long line that circled the building. The speaker -- and the man assigned to introduce him -- were called on stage by the school's African-American president. The orator made careful use of the microphone, aware that the event was being taped for television. Audience members could not help but notice how frequently he gulped Poland Spring water as he held the hot, floodlit stage for nearly an hour and a half. Only one cell phone rang during the entire evening.</p><p>None of the above happened on February 27, 1860, of course -- the day Lincoln himself made history at Cooper Union in New York, albeit to a house only three-fourths filled. In Lincoln's time, electronic amplification, broadcasting, color-blind executive opportunities at major universities, and, for that matter, bottled water, were all unknown and unimaginable.</p><p>But it did happen just as described 140 years later, on May 5, 2000. That evening, to mark the publication of the clothbound edition of this book, actor Sam Waterston mesmerized a modern audience at Cooper Union in a re-creation of Lincoln's address.</p><p>I was privileged that night to sit on stage throughout the performance, having assumed the role of <i>New York Evening Post</i> editor William Cullen Bryant, who had introduced Lincoln on February 27, 1860. I will not soon forget the thrill of listening to those seven thousand words up close, just as Bryant had. What a spellbinding oration it remains, in the hands of a speaker capable of squeezing nuance from Lincoln's canny repetition of phrases, and passion from his dazzlingly intricate peroration.</p><p>Aired repeatedly on C-SPAN, the re-creation -- and the book -- not unexpectedly rattled some archives, shaking hitherto unknown, but important information to the surface. The bad news is that the material came to light too late for inclusion in the original; the good news is that the paperback edition provides this opportunity to recognize and discuss new discoveries.</p><p>Chief among them is a long-lost letter that Lincoln wrote to Ohio Senator Thomas Corwin on October 9, 1859 -- just a week before receiving the momentous telegram inviting him to speak in the East. (Unbeknownst to Lincoln, Corwin would be asked to participate in the very same lecture series. The Senator went to Brooklyn as requested; Lincoln demurred, ending up, fortuitously, at Cooper Union). Their correspondence began when Corwin wrote Lincoln that he was worried that their party's incessant focus on slavery would doom its chances to elect a president in 1860. Lincoln believed otherwise -- and in the newly unearthed, handwritten letter, emphatically so declared. Employing frank language to the man who came close to sharing the spotlight with him in New York, Lincoln insisted Republicans ought not to try attracting Democrats to their ranks by emphasizing irrelevancies like "tariff, extravagances, live oak contracts and the like -- the very old issues upon which the Whig party was beat out of existence." The issue of slavery, Lincoln argued, not only offered moral, but political resonance:</p><p></p><blockquote>What brought these democrats with us? The Slavery issue. Drop that issue, and they have no motive to remain, and will not remain, with us. It is idiotic to think otherwise. Do you understand me as saying Illinois must have an extreme antislavery candidate? I do not so mean. We must have, though, a man who recognizes that Slavery issue as being the living issue of the day; who does not hesitate to declare slavery a wrong, nor to deal with it as such; who believes in the power, and duty of Congress to prevent the spread of it.</blockquote><p>That we now have a letter in which Lincoln used the word "idiotic" -- for the first and only time -- to warn against abandoning antislavery ideals, sheds dramatic new light on his views on the eve of his New York trip. In a way, it is too bad that Lincoln did not speak so forthrightly there. His carefully modulated Cooper Union address instead encouraged generations of observers to conclude that it showed no real antislavery zeal, although this book contends otherwise. The newly discovered Corwin letter makes clearer what Lincoln had in mind when he wrote his first speech for the East: the twin goals of placing slavery "on the course of ultimate extinction," and of improving his party's -- and his own -- prospects in the 1860 presidential campaign.</p><p>Another issue, the controversy that erupted in 1860 over Lincoln's Cooper Union honorarium, continues to elicit interest -- perhaps because modern politicians so often earn enormous fees for their speeches, a practice that arouses as much debate now as it did then. A number of readers wrote to inquire precisely what his $200 payment was really worth back in 1860. Actually, the precise value of Lincoln's honorarium remains open to interpretation. According to Inflation Watch, a much-consulted Internet website, the $200 New York fee would be equal to some $4,000 today -- a sum far less than senators and governors earn nowadays for rotary club talks. But using other formulas that also take into account stock-market inflation, the $200 of 1860 might be worth tens, even hundreds of thousands of dollars in the 21st century. That makes it easier to understand why the honorarium became a political issue. The last word on Lincoln's true value, however, properly belongs to one of those who paid for him to speak. And as co-host James A. Briggs wrote in the letter that accompanied his fee for lecturing at Cooper Union:</p><p></p><blockquote>Enclosed please find "check" for $200. I would that it were $200,000. for you are worthy of it. You "hit the nail on the head" here; &amp; long, very long will your speech be remembered in this City. It did great good, it was so weaved &amp; linked with truth, that it convinced men.</blockquote><p>Yet it apparently convinced more men in Manhattan than in Brooklyn -- the place Lincoln expected to deliver it -- reminding us how fortunate he was that his appearance was moved across the East River. On the day he was to appear at Cooper Union, in fact, the Brooklyn <i>Daily Eagle</i> lashed out with a querulous item, unknown and unpublished since, belittling the Republican party's recent, and popular, lecture series:</p><p></p><blockquote>Under the guise of literary entertainments, such men as G. W. Curtis, Wendell Phillips, and others, have in our lecture rooms preached the doctrines of [New York Senator William H.] Seward and [antislavery chronicler of the South Hinton] Helper. Many who habitually attend lectures are generally attracted more by the desire to see some celebrity than by the subject of his discourse; and many go to see Phillips, Harrison, and Cassius M. Clay out of mere curiosity to see the men, as they would as soon go to see Barnum's mermaid. As a class, lecture-goers are a people who do not usually attend political meetings. Latterly the disguise of literary discourses has been thrown off, and the Republicans have openly announced their political lectures. But clinging to the claptrap of the lecture system, they have brought out only great guns from abroad, whose fame and notoriety had excited a curiosity to see them. A course of Republican lectures is now in progress at the Cooper Institute. Phillips, Giddings, and Clay have delivered themselves; to-night, Abraham Lincoln, Douglas's Republican competitor from Illinois, will hold forth.</blockquote><p>And so Lincoln did -- unforgettably. In large part, he "held forth" by dramatically repeating the phrase "our fathers" no less than thirty times. Several readers wrote to point out that its use was not novel for "Barnum's mermaid" from Illinois. True enough. As Lincoln declared during the Lincoln-Douglas debates a year and a half earlier: "I say...there is no way of putting an end to the slavery agitation amongst us but to put it back upon the basis where our fathers placed it." But not until New York did Lincoln make the notion the central theme of a major speech. At Cooper Union, the phrase "our fathers" echoed so often that one can imagine Lincoln basing the volley on a scene from one of his favorite author's best-known plays. After all, the constant reminder that <i>"our fathers understood this [slavery] question just as well, and even better, than we do now"</i> reverberates with the same kind of impactful frequency with which Marc Antony reminded friends, Romans, and countrymen that "Caesar was an honorable man," in the funeral oration from Shakespeare's <i>Julius Caesar.</i></p><p>Finally, several readers wrote to ask if Lincoln invented the most famous line of his Cooper Union speech -- his declaration that "right makes might." Truth to say, it is hard to know for sure. Lincoln once described himself as a "retailer," not an inventor, of his funniest stories, and the same may be true about his serious writing. His "of the people, by the people, for the people" at Gettysburg, for example, owed much to a similar, earlier turn of phrase by Transcendentalist preacher Theodore Parker. As for "right makes might," the expression was certainly percolating in the national vocabulary at the time, particularly within the roiling debate over slavery.</p><p>Writing in <i>Douglass' Monthly</i> three months before Lincoln rose to speak at Cooper Union, ex-slave and abolition advocate Frederick Douglass observed: "Slavery...shields itself behind <i>might,</i> rather than right." Did Lincoln read the newspaper and commit the sentiment to his extraordinarily elastic memory? We do not know for certain, but if he ever did consult the publication, November 1859 would have been the most likely month for him to do so. At precisely that time, fretting over his upcoming East Coast lecture, Lincoln was grappling with the political fallout from John Brown's recent, bloody abolitionist raid at Harpers Ferry. Douglass's interesting turn of phrase could be found in that month's editorial, "Capt. John Brown Not Insane." As usual, if Lincoln indeed "retailed" the phrase "might, rather than rig...</p></p><h2>A Singular View: The Art of Seeing With One Eye</h2><p>Excellent resource for those with monocular vision.

Connelly presents the fullest and most vivid picture yet of how priestesses lived and worked, from the most famous and sacred of them--the Delphic Oracle and the priestess of Athena Polias--to basket bearers and handmaidens. Along the way, she challenges long-held beliefs to show that priestesses played far more significant public roles in ancient Greece than previously acknowledged.</p><p>Connelly builds this history through a pioneering examination of archaeological evidence in the broader context of literary sources, inscriptions, sculpture, and vase painting. Ranging from southern Italy to Asia Minor, and from the late Bronze Age to the fifth century A.D., she brings the priestesses to life--their social origins, how they progressed through many sacred roles on the path to priesthood, and even how they dressed. She sheds light on the rituals they performed, the political power they wielded, their systems of patronage and compensation, and how they were honored, including in death. Connelly shows that understanding the complexity of priestesses' lives requires us to look past the simple lines we draw today between public and private, sacred and secular.</p><p>The remarkable picture that emerges reveals that women in religious office were not as secluded and marginalized as we have thought--that religious office was one arena in ancient Greece where women enjoyed privileges and authority comparable to that of men. Connelly concludes by examining women's roles in early Christianity, taking on the larger issue of the exclusion of women from the Christian priesthood. This paperback edition includes additional maps and a glossary for student use.</p></p><p><p>"Joan Connelly . . . has produced a fascinating book on the central role of priestesses in ancient Greek society. Her survey is fully documented and beautifully illustrated. One cannot but admire her enthusiasm for the subject and her deft handling of the evidence."--<b>Colin Austin, University of Cambridge, coeditor of <i>Aristophanes Thesmophoriazusae</i></b></p><p>"There was a great need for a book of this kind. Through direct observation of artifacts, the author offers many original ideas, and even manages to correct some long-held erroneous readings of ancient texts. Her emphasis on the important role played by some women in classical antiquity is a welcome corrective to the stereotype of the subordinate female in the Greek world. The remarkably wide-ranging material will be of great interest not only to archaeologists but also to scholars in various fields."--<b>Brunilde S. Ridgway, Professor Emerita, Bryn Mawr College, author of <i>Prayers in Stone: Greek Architectural Sculpture (c. 600-100 B.C.E.)</i></b></p><p>"This is the first full presentation in English or in any language of the female priest in the ancient Greek world. Connelly adduces evidence that women all over the Greek world had, as priestesses, positions of great public influence in their communities. I predict this study will have a wide readership by general classicists as well as those interested in ancient religion, ancient society, and women in ancient Greece, not to mention by art historians. This promises to be a landmark study."--<b>Stephen V. Tracy, American School of Classical Studies at Athens, author of <i>Athens and Macedon: Attic Letter-Cutters of 300 to 229 B.C.</i></b></p><p>"There has long been a need for a book devoted to the role of the priestess in ancient Greece. After reading Connelly, no one could fail to be persuaded that priestesses could play an important role in society or that they were given significant honors. This book will do much to improve and extend our understanding of the role of Greek women both in religion and in society."--<b>Mary Lefkowitz, Wellesley College, author of <i>Greek Gods, Human Lives: What We Can Learn from Myths</i></b></p><b>Joan Breton Connelly</b> is Professor of Classics and Art History at New York University.

On the battlefields of multiple worlds in the Mid Rim, legions of ruthless stormtroopers&#x2014;bent on crushing resistance to the Empire wherever it arises&#x2014;are waging close and brutal combat against an armada of freedom fighters.

When orders come down for the rebels to fall back in the face of superior opposition numbers and firepower, Twilight reluctantly complies.

Born near Philadelphia, he endeavors to bring the city&#x2019;s dour charm with him to his current home of Austin, Texas.Chapter 1<br><br>Planet Crucival<br><br>Day Forty-�Seven of the Malkhani Insurrections<br><br>Thirteen Years After the Clone Wars<br><br>His name was Donin, and though that wasn&#x2019;t the name he&#x2019;d been born with, he had the ink-�rubbed brands to prove it. The black whorls and waves, freshly applied by the clan masters in honor of his induction, ran across his dusky shoulder blades under his coarse cloth jacket. They were one of four gifts he&#x2019;d received upon joining the army of the Warlord Malkhan: a new name, the brands, a serrated knife, and an offworlder&#x2019;s particle blaster.<br><br>The masters had assured him that of the four gifts, the blaster was the most precious. Its grip was wrapped in fraying leather and its barrel was scored and crusted with ash. It had enough power left to fire a dozen searing bolts, and Donin had been warned not to waste a single shot or drop it if it began to burn his palms. Those were the acts of a child&#x2014;�not a full member of the clan.<br><br>He knelt among his new brothers and sisters&#x2014;�he&#x2019;d yet to learn their names&#x2014;�behind a low stone wall that stretched across the hilltop. His slight frame, thin from youth and hunger, allowed him to conceal himself fully behind the barricade; for this reason he had been assigned to the front. Like his brands and weapons, that assignment was a privilege. He reminded himself as much when he began to sweat and tremble.<br><br>He glanced sidelong at his companions and looked for signs that they, too, were afraid of the coming battle. They were nearly all larger and older, carrying offworld weapons that appeared as scored and rusted as his own. They cleaned their knives and murmured to one another. Donin told himself he would die for them as they would die for him, in the name of the clan and its warlord. And if they won the day&#x2014;�<br><br>If I survive the battle, Donin corrected himself. Victory was inevitable for the Warlord Malkhan. Only Donin&#x2019;s own fate was in question.<br><br>&#x2014;�then they would celebrate. He&#x2019;d heard stories of feasts, of troughs of clear water and skewers of bantha meat, of salts and sauces from other continents, other planets. He would gorge himself, he thought, and sleep in safety in the warlord&#x2019;s camp. He&#x2019;d heard the clan&#x2019;s celebrations before, while hiding shivering in his father&#x2019;s home, and those joyful cries were what had finally lured him to the masters.<br><br>His father had said the Malkhanis were no different from any other faction on Crucival, but his father was wrong. No one else had such food or took so much joy in victory. No one else was as strong as Malkhan, or had the wisdom to procure such a trove of offworld technology. Donin&#x2019;s new clan would build a better planet.<br><br>Something far away howled in the dusty air, starting soft and rising rapidly. Donin squared his shoulders, half stood from his crouch, and thrust his blaster over the wall in one movement, as he&#x2019;d been taught. He saw no target. A man&#x2019;s voice laughed behind him, and a broad palm cupped his dark hair and tilted his head back.<br><br>&#x201c;Battle ain&#x2019;t started yet, boy. Just a ship headed to the tower. Get us all killed if you shoot.&#x201d;<br><br>His gaze redirected, Donin saw the sphere and crossbars of an offworld flier silhouetted against the clouds. It roared in the direction of the steel spire and faded from view.<br><br>Donin lowered himself to his knees again, and the hand on his head disappeared. He&#x2019;d made a fool of himself. He silently pledged not to do it again. &#x201c;We didn&#x2019;t see them much in the Gulches,&#x201d; he �murmured&#x2014;� an explanation, not an excuse.<br><br>The man behind him grunted. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ll see them a lot here. I&#x2019;m serious about not shooting. Don&#x2019;t go within a stone&#x2019;s throw of the tower, either, no matter what happens. The offworlders in white may not come out much, but you bother them even a little . . .&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I know,&#x201d; Donin snapped. He swiveled and looked up at the man, who could have been four times Donin&#x2019;s age, with milky eyes and pitted skin. Older than the warlord himself. But that didn&#x2019;t mean he&#x2019;d been part of the clan any longer than Donin. &#x201c;I know all about them. Their soldiers are clones. They make them in batches.&#x201d;<br><br>The man grunted again, showing cracked yellow teeth in something that might have been a smile. &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t say? Who told you that?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;My father,&#x201d; Donin said. &#x201c;He used to fight them.&#x201d; He gestured with his head toward the sky, toward the stars hidden behind yellow-�gray clouds. &#x201c;There was a war.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Well, you&#x2019;re not fighting clones,&#x201d; the man said. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re fighting the lowlifes who took the quarry last week and want our territory. That exciting enough for you?&#x201d;<br><br>Donin scowled and stared. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m here to serve the clan,&#x201d; he said, and pivoted back to face the wall. One hand still clasping his blaster, he reached with the other to jerk down the collar of his jacket, displaying his brands to the man behind him.<br><br>Donin heard the man laugh, felt a slap on his spine that rocked him forward.<br><br>&#x201c;I guess you are,&#x201d; the man said. &#x201c;Just don&#x2019;t get your hopes up. Take it one fight at a time.&#x201d;<br><br>Donin nodded, shrugged his jacket higher on his back, and gripped his blaster tighter. He wasn&#x2019;t sure what the man meant. The clan was hope for them all.<br><br>It wasn&#x2019;t long before someone yelled that the enemy was approaching. The front line pressed against the wall and peered over. Donin saw specks against the brittle yellow grass in the valley below the hill, and soon those specks resolved into the shapes of dozens of men and women. Most held spears above their heads like pennants. Only a few carried offworld weapons&#x2014;�but those weapons were the size of tree branches, cradled by their owners in both arms.<br><br>The first of those weapons ignited with reverberating screams. Streaks of green fire spewed over the wall. The warlord&#x2019;s army became a mass of shouts Donin didn&#x2019;t understand. He steadied his blaster, reminded himself not to waste shots.<br><br>&#x201c;All praise to the warlord!&#x201d; someone called, and the shouting became a cheer. A rush of warmth filled the boy as he grinned and added his voice to the hurrah.<br><br>His name was Donin now. He was defending his new home. These were his brothers and sisters, their path was righteous, and he&#x2019;d be part of their clan forever.<br><br>Chapter 2<br><br>Planet Hai�doral Prime<br><br>Day Eighty-�Four of the Mid Rim Retreat<br><br>Nine Years Later<br><br>The rain on Hai�doral Prime dropped in warm sheets from a shining sky. It smelled like vinegar, clung to the molded curves of modular industrial buildings and to litter-�strewn streets, and coated skin like a sheen of acrid sweat.<br><br>After thirty standard hours, it was losing its novelty for the soldiers of Twilight Company.<br><br>Three figures crept along a deserted avenue under a torn and dripping canopy. The lean, compact man in the lead was dressed in faded gray fatigues and a hodgepodge of armor pads crudely stenciled with the starbird symbol of the Rebel Alliance. Matted dark hair dripped beneath his visored helmet, sending crawling trails of rainwater down his bronze face.<br><br>His name was Hazram Namir, though he&#x2019;d gone by others. He silently cursed urban warfare and Hai�doral Prime and whichever laws of atmospheric science made it rain. The thought of sleep flashed into his mind and broke against a wall of stubbornness. He gestured with a rifle thicker than his arm toward the nearest intersection, then quickened his pace.<br><br>Somewhere in the distance a swift series of blaster shots resounded, followed by shouts and silence.<br><br>The figure closest behind Namir&#x2014;�a tall man with graying hair and a face puckered with scar tissue&#x2014;�bounded across the street to take up a position opposite. The third figure, a massive form huddled in a tarp like a hooded cloak, remained behind.<br><br>The scarred man flashed a hand signal. Namir turned the corner onto the intersecting street. A dozen meters away, the sodden lumps of human bodies lay in the road. They wore tattered rain gear&#x2014;�sleek, lightweight wraps and sandals&#x2014;�and carried no weapons. Noncombatants.<br><br>It&#x2019;s a shame, Namir thought, but not a bad sign. The Empire didn&#x2019;t shoot civilians when everything was under control.<br><br>&#x201c;Charmer&#x2014;�take a look?&#x201d; Namir indicated the bodies. The scarred man strode over as Namir tapped his comlink. &#x201c;Sector secure,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s on tap next?&#x201d;<br><br>The response came in a hiss of static through Namir&#x2019;s earpiece&#x2014;�something about mop-�up operations. Namir missed having a communications specialist on staff. Twilight Company&#x2019;s last comm tech had been a drunk and a misanthrope, but she&#x2019;d been magic with a transmitter and she&#x2019;d written obscene poetry with Namir on late, dull nights. She and her idiot droid had died in the bombardment on Asyrphus.<br><br>&#x201c;Say again,&#x201d; Namir tried. &#x201c;Are we ready to load?&#x201d;<br><br>This time the answer came through clearly. &#x201c;Support teams are crating up food and equipment,&#x201d; the voice said. &#x201c;If you&#x2019;ve got a lead on medical supplies, we&#x2019;d love more for the Thunderstrike. Otherwise, get to the rendezvous&#x2014;�we only have a few hours before reinforcements show.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Tell support to grab hygiene items this time,&#x201d; Namir said. &#x201c;Anyone who says they&#x2019;re luxuries needs to smell the barracks.&#x201d;<br><br>There was another burst of static, and maybe a laugh. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll let them know. Stay safe.&#x201d;<br><br>Charmer was finishing his study of the bodies, checking each for a heartbeat and identification. He shook his head, silent, as he straightened.<br><br>&#x201c;Atrocity.&#x201d; The hulking figure wrapped in the tarp had finally approached. His voice was deep and resonant. Two meaty, four-�fingered hands kept the tarp clasped at his shoulders, while a second pair of hands loosely carried a massive blaster cannon at waist level. &#x201c;How can anyone born of flesh do this?&#x201d;<br><br>Charmer bit his lip. Namir shrugged. &#x201c;Could&#x2019;ve been combat droids, for all we know.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Unlikely,&#x201d; the hulking figure said. &#x201c;But if so, responsibility belongs to the governor.&#x201d; He knelt beside one of the corpses and reached out to lid its eyes. Each of his hands was as large as the dead man&#x2019;s head.</p><h2>When Corruption Was King: How I Helped the Mob Rule Chicago, Then Brought the Outfit Down</h2><p>Bob Cooley was the Chicago Mafia&#x2019;s fixer of court cases. During the 1970s and &#x2018;80s, Cooley bribed judges, juries, and cops to keep his Mob clients out of jail. Paid handsomely for his services, he lived fast and enjoyed the protection of the men he served. Yet, by the end of the &#x2018;90s, without a pending conviction, he became the star witness in nine federal trials that took down the most powerful Mafia family in the history of organized crime. When Corruption Was King is the story of a Mob lawyer turned mole with a million-dollar contract on his head who went back and forth between sin and sainthood&#x2014;a turbulent youth, a stint on Chicago&#x2019;s police force, law school, and then the inner sanctum of Chicago&#x2019;s wiseguys. He dined with Mob bosses and shared &#x201c;last suppers&#x201d; with friends before their gangland executions. In a startling act of conscience, Cooley walked into the office of the U.S. Organized Crime Strike Force and agreed to wear a wire on the very same Mafia overlords who had made him a player. This book, including eight pages of memorable photographs, reveals the personal story behind the federal government&#x2019;s most successful Mafia investigation.</p><p><b>Robert Cooley</b>&nbsp;grew up in Chicago and has recently lived in several cities around the country. He currently speaks about his career and consults with law enforcement agencies about undercover investigations.<b>Hillel Levin</b> has been a contributing writer for <i>The Nation</i>, a staff writer for <i>New York</i>, and editor for <i>Chicago</i> magazine. He is also the author of <i>Grand Delusions: The Cosmic Career of John DeLorean </i>and&nbsp;coauthor of <i>In With the Devil </i>with James Keene. He lives in a suburb outside Chicago.Fans of insider Mob books should thrill to this account (midwifed by veteran writer and magazine editor Levin) of a guy who wore a wire against the Chicago Outfit and lived (in greatly reduced circumstances in the Witness Protection Program and in constant danger) to tell the tale. Cooley was a lawyer who "got bent." In Chicago, that means a lawyer who sells out by defending the hit men and functionaries of the Mob, while greasing the wheels for them with Mob-connected politicians and police. Cooley begins the story with autobiography, from his upbringing through his slide into Mob lawyering to his walk into the Organized Crime Strike Force office in 1986 with an offer to wear a wire against the mobsters he represented for years. The book also offers a revealing analysis of how the Mob was able to gain a stranglehold over Chicago's government, court system, and police. And it takes a revealing peek into Mob rituals, like the "last suppers" held on the eve of a mobster's execution. And it's a thriller, as readers accompany Cooley on sweat-raising stings and meets. The result of Cooley's return to values was his becoming a star witness in nine federal trials that crippled the Chicago Outfit. Levin's notes at book's end offer more details from various sources on Cooley's assertions. A mesmerizing treatise on organized crime. <i>Connie Fletcher</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Both the twelve-year-old and his father become fugitives, forced to run from Coos County&#x2013;to Boston, to southern Vermont, to Toronto&#x2013;pursued by the implacable constable. Their lone protector is a fiercely libertarian logger, once a river driver, who befriends them.<br><br>In a story spanning five decades, <b>Last Night in Twisted River</b>&#x2013;John Irving&#x2019;s twelfth novel&#x2013;depicts the recent half-century in the United States as &#x201c;a living replica of Coos County, where lethal hatreds were generally permitted to run their course.&#x201d; From the novel&#x2019;s taut opening sentence&#x2013;&#x201c;The young Canadian, who could not have been more than fifteen, had hesitated too long&#x201d;&#x2013;to its elegiac final chapter, <b>Last Night in Twisted River</b> is written with the historical authenticity and emotional authority of <b>The Cider House Rules</b> and A <b>Prayer for Owen Meany.</b> It is also as violent and disturbing a story as John Irving&#x2019;s breakthrough bestseller, <b>The World According to Garp.</b><br><br>What further distinguishes <b>Last Night in Twisted River</b> is the author&#x2019;s unmistakable voice&#x2013;the inimitable voice of an accomplished storyteller. Near the end of this moving novel, John Irving writes: &#x201c;We don&#x2019;t always have a choice how we get to know one another. Sometimes, people fall into our lives cleanly&#x2013;as if out of the sky, or as if there were a direct flight from Heaven to Earth&#x2013;the same sudden way we lose people, who once seemed they would always be part of our lives.&#x201d;</p><p><strong>Amazon Best of the Month, October 2009:</strong> A long, delicious trip to the land of Irving is hands-down the best way to begin the month of October. A trio of tragic events (though the prize for most hell-shocking goes to the third) exiles widower and camp cook Dominic Baciagalupo and his son Danny from a mid-century logging outpost called Twisted River. They leave behind the Bunyan-esque lumberjack Ketchum--a gruff, eccentric, dyed-in-the-wool Yankee--who remains their sole connection to the past. What's next neither father nor son knows: their rootless existence moves swiftly in and out of New England, tied ostensibly to jobs for Dominic and schools for Danny, but it seems one foot is always back in those New Hampshire woods. Theirs is a restless, richly observed journey, crowned by a reckoning no one could predict. Few writers can match John Irving's knack for <em>denouement</em>, and in <em>Last Night in Twisted River</em>, his extraordinary ending is made all the more powerful by a story that feasts on language, life, and love. --<em>Anne Bartholomew</em>John Irving published his first novel, <b>Setting Free the Bears</b>, in 1968. He has been nominated for a National Book Award three times&#x2013;winning once, in 1980, for the novel <b>The World According to Garp</b>. He also received an O. Henry Award, in 1981, for the short story &#x201c;Interior Space.&#x201d; In 1992, Mr. Irving was inducted into the National Wrestling Hall of Fame in Stillwater, Oklahoma. In 2000, he won the Oscar for Best Adapted Screenplay for <b>The Cider House Rules</b>&#x2013;a film with seven Academy Award nominations. In 2001, he was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Letters. <b>Last Night in Twisted River </b>is John Irving&#x2019;s twelfth novel.</p><h2>Never Tease a Weasel (Picture Book)</h2><p>A funny, finger-wagging rhyme with some very good advice: never tease a weasel, because teasing isn't nice! Rather, kids should do <i>nice </i>things for animals, such as bake a drake a cake, or give a mule a pool, and much more. Long out of print, this new edition of <i>Never Tease a Weasel </i>with art by the great <i>New Yorker </i>cartoonist George Booth will surely please a weasel, and everyone else who reads it!</p><p>Jean Conder Soule wrote many books and poems for children in the '60s and '70s, and she's thrilled to see an old favorite come back. She lives in Pennsylvania. <br><br>Since 1969, George Booth's illustrations have been an iconic feature of the <i>New Yorker </i>magazine. He also illustrated the classic Dr. Seuss book <i>Wacky Wednesday</i>. He and his wife, Dione, live in Stony Brook, New York.PreSchool-Grade 3&#x2014;Soule's 1964 picture book has been reissued with new illustrations by a New Yorker cartoonist, and the result is a marvelous meld of text and art. The "be kind to animals" lesson is crafted in such slyly humorous terms that it's sure to win universal acceptance, even as it's met with giggles and grins. As a boy and girl tease a weasel in a variety of ways, Soule suggests other ways to makes friends with animals, such as making a goat a coat or giving a mule "a pool/And some jaunty swimming trunks." The animals look appropriately awkward and uncomfortable with these "kindnesses." As Soule observes: "You can knit a kitten mittens,/And perhaps that cat would purr," Booth draws a wide-eyed feline gazing warily from a safe distance at a pair of clunky, oversize mittens. In the end, the children and weasel snuggle on a couch, since: "It's more fun to please a weasel/and be friends with him instead." Soule's zany suggestions beg to be read aloud, and Booth's line drawings with bright daubs of color perfectly capture the lighthearted goings-on. Reminiscent of Judi Barrett's <i>Animals Should Definitely Not Wear Clothing</i> (S &amp; S, 1970), this charmer's inspired silliness will win a wide audience.&#x2014;<i>Marilyn Taniguchi, Beverly Hills Public Library, CA</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

His work has appeared in <i>Omni,</i> and he is the author of <i>Fire in the Crucible</i> and coauthor of <i>Turbulent Mirror.</i> He is currently at wok on his next book, <i>The Universe as a Work of Art.</i><p> <b>A PLANET OF LIVING FRACTALS</b> </p><p> <i>If the eye attempts to follow the flight of a gaudy butterfly, it is arrested by some strange tree or fruit; if watching an insect, one forgets it in the strange flower it is crawling over; if turning to admire the splendour of the scenery, the individual character of the foreground fixes the attention. The mind is a chaos of delight...</i><br> Charles Darwin,<br> writing home from his <i>Beagle</i> voyage on his impressions of the Brazilian tropical rain forest. </p><p> Hike into a forest and you are surrounded by fractals. The inexhaustible detail of the living world (with its worlds within worlds) provides inspiration for photographers, painters, and seekers of spiritual solace: the rugged whorls of bark, the recurring branching of trees, the erratic path of a rabbit bursting from underfoot into the brush, and the fractal pattern in the cacophonous call of peepers on a spring night. </p><p> The landscape is the crucible in which living forms have evolved, and since the landscape crackles with fractals, the forms bred there are fractal as well. Living creatures, from trees to beetles to whales, have shapes and behaviors that provide a fractal record of the dynamical forces (the endless feedback) that act upon them and within them, forces that have continually caused them to evolve new niches in which to live. In his <i>Boston Globe</i> newspaper column, physicist and science writer Chet Raymo declared after seeing a museum exhibition of beetles, "Darwinian explanations are reasonable enough, but...the spectacular variability of beetles suggests that nature is infected by...a sheer lunatic exuberance for diversity, a manic propensity to try any damn thing that looks good or works." </p><p> The riotous beauty and dreamlike strangeness of nature provided a chief inspiration for Charles Darwin as he struggled to develop a coherent theory of evolution. Psychologist Howard Gruber, who has done a lengthy study of how Darwin arrived at his theory, says, "The meaning of his whole creative life work is saturated with...duality.... </p><p> On the one hand, he wanted to face squarely the entire panorama of changeful organic nature in its amazing variety, its numberless and beautiful contrivances, and its disturbing irregularity and imperfections. On the other hand, he was imbued with the spirit of Newtonian science and hoped to find in this shimmering network a few simple laws that might explain the whole movement of nature." Darwin concludes his landmark <i>Origin of Species</i> with a striking metaphor of nature as "the tangled bank," reveling in what Gruber calls "the spectacle of complexity itself." Indeed, the pattern -- the image -- that gave Darwin his essential insight into how evolution works was a classic fractal: He conceived of the evolving forms of nature as an irregularly branching tree. </p><p> Examining Darwin's notebooks, Gruber carefully tracked Darwin's creative process to the moment when this image emerged in his thought. Gruber initially expected Darwin's mental processes on evolution would be "fine, clean, direct," but soon found that they were "tortuous, tentative, enormously complex." Gruber realized that "Darwin's picture of nature as an irregularly branching tree attributed to nature some of the characteristics I saw in his thinking." </p><p> According to Gruber, after considerable mental bifurcation Darwin reached a point where he drew in his notebook three tree diagrams which captured his insight that all creatures are related to one another through a process of branching pushed forward by natural selection. Darwin had found a simple law that could explain life's breathtaking complexity. </p><p> Through the ages artists have been driven by a desire to capture life's simultaneous complexity and simplicity in a single image or work. Some artists have created simple images with hugely complex overtones; others have spun out complex images that imply a simple order beneath. Artistic "truth" seems to involve presentation of a <i>dynamic balance</i> between these two opposites. Darwin's admiration for complexity and his belief in the Newtonian model of simple natural laws brought him an important step toward the artist's aesthetic (sense of harmony and dissonance), but in the end the emphasis of evolutionary theory fell on the simplicity side of the equation -- on scientific law. Many of the scientists of chaos (though certainly not all) now seem bent on readjusting the balance. Accordingly, they are proclaiming a new dynamic that emphasizes how complexity can be wrought from simple rules while at the same time revealing a challenging new perception that the laws of complexity will forever prevent the kind of simple predictability and control over nature implied by the clockwork Newtonian model of the world that Darwin had admired. </p><p> Using simple mathematical rules, chaologists can now model complex dynamical systems, formulating rules to mimic on a computer such natural phenomena as the flocking pattern of birds flying to a roosting spot and the growing branch and leaf forms of specific flowers and trees. Chaos theory and fractal geometry have opened up undreamed of correspondences between the abstract mental realm of mathematics and the movements and shapes of our planet's myriad organisms. The seemingly endless niches in nature, for example, can now be perceived as an analogue for the intricate complexity which fractal geometers have found in the nooks and crannies of the Mandelbrot set. Indeed, the idea of niche itself can now be understood as a fractal idea. </p><p> Niche means a corner or space. Biologists have traditionally used the word to signify the little empty corner of an ecosystem that an organism evolves to fill; a niche presents an opportunity for evolution. If one species of cormorant nests on high cliffs with broad ledges and eats a certain kind of diet, another species will evolve with special characteristics that allow it to nest lower down on narrow ledges and eat a slightly different diet -- so the two species occupy different niches. In this traditional view, nature abhors a vacuum and will evolve new forms to fill it. But, in fact, the situation is considerably more subtle. An organism creates the niche it occupies as much as it is <i>created by</i> the existence of an unexploited region of the ecosystem. New spaces or niches constantly come into being, unfolded by the total activity of organisms. When a species dies out, the fold (or niche) smooths over or is further crumpled into other folds. The great biological diversity on the planet is a sign that nature is continually rippling with new and related niches. It is like the surface of the sea wrinkling in the wind. </p><p> The constant crumpling of reality that we see in evolution takes place over millennia as species emerge and pass away, creating new landscapes, new environments, and new opportunities for new species. The old scientific concept of the "balance of nature" is quietly being replaced by a new concept of the dynamic, creative, and marvelously diversified "chaos of nature." </p><p> Copyright � 1992 by John Briggs</p></p><h2>Interesting Times (Discworld)</h2><p>1st Corgi 1995 edition 1st printing paperback, vg++ In stock shipped from our UK warehouse</p><p>Marvelous Discworld, which revolves on the backs of four great elephants and a big turtle, spins into <i>Interesting Times</i>, the 17th outing in Terry Pratchett's rollicking fantasy series.

Dive out!</i> training and reflex said.</p><p>She did. Her hands and feet moved on the controls of the glider with delicate precision, coaxing the last ounce of performance out of the Glaser&#x2013;Dirk 100. Air whistled by, the loudest thing in the profound silence of the sky; the cockpit was paradoxically stuffy and smelled of lubricants, ancient plastic and fresher leather and fear&#x2013;sweat. The falling&#x2013;sled sensation went away, but she&#x2019;d gone down three or four hundred crucial feet. Her head whipped around, and she saw uncomfortably high ground all around her, a situation that had gone from <i>chancy </i> to <i>bad </i> all at once. This was unfamiliar territory, known only from the map&#x2014;that was the whole point of reconnaissance flying, but it made things a lot more dangerous. Over the country she knew well the spots for likely lift were all as familiar as the feel of her bootlaces. Here, not so much.</p><p><i>Of course, I know where the nearest three landing points are. Only now I can&#x2019;t get to any of them.</i></p><p>She was over dense forest, with a saw&#x2013;toothed ridge of nearly vertical rock directly ahead; she could get to it, but not over it to the steep river&#x2013;valley beyond. Alyssa shoved the goggles up on the forehead of her leather helmet, hiding the snarling face&#x2013;on bear&#x2019;s head worked into the hide there. Her eyes peered at the air over the ridge.</p><p><i>Shit. No birds.</i></p><p>Birds were a good way to find air moving upward; lots of them didn&#x2019;t like to flap if they could avoid it. So probably no updraft directly ahead. She was sweating and her mouth was dry, but there was no <i>time</i> to be afraid. Her hand moved on the stick, very gently, no rudder, just the shallowest of banking turns to cruise along the face of the ridge looking for a spot where there <i>was</i> an updraft.</p><p><i>No joy.</i></p><p>The aircraft was losing one foot of altitude for every forty it went forward towards a sheer slope, and there weren&#x2019;t that many feet left before you ran into the trees and rocks below. She was moving faster than a galloping horse, faster than a pedalcar on rails, faster than virtually anything else in the world except a peregrine falcon stooping or a catapult bolt, and when hundreds of pounds hit at speed . . . the gentle floating of the glider would abruptly transition to nasty un&#x2013;Changed calculations of kinetic energy release and the strength factors of human bone and tissue. <i>Her</i> bone and tissue. The only good thing was that this wasn&#x2019;t happening over enemy&#x2013;held territory; it was pretty well uninhabited around here these days.</p><p><i>If I can get this thing down in one piece, we can bring in a horse team and pack it out.</i></p><p>They&#x2019;d been built to disassemble, and been modified since to do it more thoroughly.</p><p>&#x201c;All right, my beauty, let&#x2019;s <i>do</i> this,&#x201d; she muttered.</p><p>Some of her older instructors had been pilots before the Change, when powered aircraft could just bull their way through the air. Most of the time she agreed with the modern school which held that dancing with the invisible currents of the sky&#x2013;ocean was preferable, but right now something to just <i>push</i> would be welcome. And aesthetics be damned.</p><p>&#x201c;Well, shit, Bearkiller,&#x201d; she told herself as she leveled out again, sparing a quick glance downward.</p><p>&#x201c;OK, the Bear Lord was aloft in something a lot less aerodynamic and with a lot higher stall speed than this over mountains not all that far from here when the Change hit. With Dad and Aunt Signe and all in the backseats. Uncle Mike walked away . . . well, swam away . . . from a real hard landing, the rest of the family survived too; so will you if it comes to that.&#x201d;</p><p><i>Although he just barely survived. Holy Mary Mother of God, if he hadn&#x2019;t&#x2014;</i></p><p>Since she&#x2019;d gotten her wings a little while ago she had a much better grasp of what a combination of blind luck and superlative piloting had been required at the very beginning of the Bearkiller legend. Her mind blanched at the thought that the whole world she knew including her personal self wouldn&#x2019;t have existed if her aunt&#x2019;s future husband been just a little less skillful or fortunate.</p><p><i>So I&#x2019;ve got to live. Maybe as much depends on me!</i></p><p>She turned away from the ridge to try and get closer to base. That ridge ahead was going to be <i>really</i> close, looking like a fanged jaw reaching for her. Her gut tightened in an involuntary effort to haul the sailplane upward by sheer willpower. She absolutely needed to climb at least a bit, but she <i>couldn&#x2019;t</i> put the nose any higher. If she tried she wouldn&#x2019;t climb, she&#x2019;d just drop below stalling speed and fall out of the sky like a leaf in autumn as the wings lost lift.</p><p><i>Like a leaf in autumn except for the last crunchy bit. Just a little more, then slam the stick down once I clear the crest to get some margin back, then go looking for an updraft&#x2014;</i></p><p>Speed was dropping. Dropping fast, <i>too</i> fast. Reflex tried to make her turn the nose down again, but that would mean diving into the mountain slope so bloody damned close below.</p><p><i>Just another hundred yards . . .</i></p><p>Stalling felt like slipping backward an instant after the controls went mushy.</p><p><i>Oh</i> <i>fuck me, what utter brass&#x2013;assed moron came up with this mission in the first place&#x2014;</i></p><p>The left wingtip brushed the top of a tall larch less than a second later.

Rudi Mackenzie stayed in the shadows at the back of the tent, arms crossed on his chest, ignored after a single startled glance and a jerk of Rudi&#x2019;s head towards Fred. The man who was now High King Artos of Montival kept silent; he was scrupulous in not interfering in the chain of command without very pressing need, and with Fred such was very rare indeed.</p><p><i>Though there&#x2019;s need more often than I&#x2019;d like with others.</i></p><p>Artos the First was a young man, a Changeling as it was called here&#x2014;he&#x2019;d been born near Yule of that year&#x2014;but the High Kingdom of Montival was far younger. Its armies were cobbled together from what had been a dozen separate realms, many of them with a history of mutual suspicion or outright battle. Everything was a makeshift of constant improvisation.</p><p><i>You fight with what you have, not what you&#x2019;d wish</i>, Rudi thought.</p><p>Even if you were fighting the biggest war since the Change. Certainly the biggest in North America since then, if you didn&#x2019;t count the desperate scrambles in the months after the machines stopped. Not the biggest in the world, probably; Asia still weighed heavily in the nine&#x2013;tenths&#x2013;reduced total of humankind. Rumors trickled in now and then across seas pirate&#x2013;haunted when they weren&#x2019;t empty. They spoke of warlords fighting each other and invaders from Mongolia and Tibet across the ruins of China, and the bloody rise of <i>Mahendr Shuddhikartaa hai</i>&#x2014;Mahendra the Purifier&#x2014;carving out a new empire called Hinduraj on the Bay of Bengal. . . .</p><p><i>The world is wider and wilder than we can know. But this is the part the Powers have set me to ward.</i></p><p>The defector and Fred had gotten down to cases more rapidly than Rudi would have considered tactful at first, which was another reason he was leaving this in his friend&#x2019;s capable hands. Someone who&#x2019;d grown up among Boise&#x2019;s folk would understand them in ways that Rudi never quite could, even bearing the Sword of the Lady. The officer wouldn&#x2019;t be his subject unless and until he came to an agreement with Fred, and even then only indirectly.</p><p>He and Fred had gone all the way to Nantucket and back together on the Quest; they were comrades and allies, but lord and sworn follower as well. Fred had come to understand the relationship those words implied, but most Boiseans didn&#x2019;t. Worse, they thought they <i>did</i> understand it.</p><p><i>Being ignorant is truly bliss compared to being misinformed, especially if you&#x2019;re aware of the depths of your own ignorance. As Mother says, it isn&#x2019;t what you don&#x2019;t know that will kill you, it&#x2019;s what you think you know that just isn&#x2019;t so.</i></p><p>&#x201c;Yes, sir, Mr. President,&#x201d; the officer said at last, saluting; he hadn&#x2019;t been invited to sit.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not President yet,&#x201d; Fred replied sharply. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s a little matter of elections first. I expect to win them . . . but I also intend to do it fair and square.&#x201d;</p><p>The man looked very slightly anxious; he was in his thirties, with Brigadier&#x2019;s insignia on his loose olive&#x2013;green linsey&#x2013;woolsey field uniform of boots and pants and patch&#x2013;pocketed jacket. Fred wore the same kit, the uniform of the realm that called itself the United States of America and ruled much of Idaho from its center at Boise, but without marks of rank at all apart from the Stars&#x2013;and&#x2013;Stripes badge on the shoulder. That ostentatious plainness was a statement in itself.</p><p>&#x201c;But we have an agreement, sir?&#x201d; the man said.</p><p>&#x201c;Certainly, Brigadier Roberts. Unless you insist on having the personal parts in writing? That could be embarrassing down the road, unless we altered some of the details.&#x201d;</p><p><i>So you&#x2019;d better hope I win the vote</i> went unspoken between them. <i>And use what influence you have to make sure I do. Someone else might not consider themselves bound by our negotiations here.</i></p><p>The man licked his lips; they were thin, like his face, and together with his cropped blond hair and pale yellowish eyes gave him the look of a wolf that had gone a little too long without a meal. Those eyes flicked towards the back of the big tent. The High King had never made any secret of the fact that one of the things the Sword gave him was the ability to tell truth from falsehood. By now, nearly everyone believed it.</p><p><i>Or more precisely, I can sense the intention to deceive, Rudi thought. The which means my simply standing here keeps him . . . relatively . . . honest.</i></p><p>Though with a man as fundamentally untruthful as this, whether <i>anything</i> he said was true at heart would be a matter for philosophers to split hairs over.</p><p>&#x201c;Of course not, sir. I wouldn&#x2019;t be here if I didn&#x2019;t trust your word.&#x201d;</p><p><i>And oddly enough, he does trust Fred&#x2019;s word. Wise enough not to judge others by himself, at least.</i></p><p>Fred nodded. &#x201c;Report to my chief of staff, and we&#x2019;ll slot your men into the overall TOE. He&#x2019;ll show you where to plant the eagle.&#x201d;</p><p>He stood and returned the brigadier&#x2019;s salute, then shook hands. The man left, his stride growing brisker with relief, and there was a clank as the armored guards outside the tent&#x2019;s entrance brought their big oval shields up and thumped the butts of their long iron&#x2013;shod throwing spears to the hard&#x2013;packed earth. Silence fell for a long moment, amid the smell of hot canvas and dust and horses and woodsmoke from the encampment beyond. There were sounds&#x2014;voices, someone counting cadence, the massed tramp of booted feet, iron on iron from a field smithy&#x2014;but they were curiously muffled.</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t like that deal at all,&#x201d; Fred said quietly, when the defector was well out of ear&#x2013;range, looking at his right hand and turning it back and forth. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll do it for three&#x2013;and&#x2013;a&#x2013;half thousand men . . . to save three&#x2013;and&#x2013;a&#x2013;half thousand men . . . but I don&#x2019;t like it at all.&#x201d;</p><p>Rudi Mackenzie smiled wryly as he came forward and sat across from him.</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t <i>like</i> it either, Fred. And neither of us <i>likes</i> fighting battles, but you do as you must, not as you would. You must have seen it with your father; I certainly did with Mother, by Nuada of the Silver Hand who favors Kings! It may mean <i>dying</i> for the people. . . .&#x201d;</p><p>Fred ran a hand over his hair, which was cut short in a cap of soft black rings. &#x201c;I think I&#x2019;d actually prefer that, sometimes.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re all <i>going</i> to die sometime, to be sure. More often ruling well means we have to do things like shaking hands and breaking bread with men we&#x2019;d rather put facedown in a dungheap with a boot to the back of their necks. The which hand&#x2013;shaking and bread&#x2013;breaking is nearly as unpleasant as death and wears harder on the soul.&#x201d;</p><p>Fred grinned in weary agreement and kneaded the back of his neck. &#x201c;Thor with me, this sort of thing wears you out worse than a march in armor. And that&#x2019;s an attractive image. The manure pile and the boot and his face, that is.&#x201d;</p><p>Rudi nodded. &#x201c;And you can wash muck off your boot, but it&#x2019;s harder to get clean of <i>that</i> sort.&#x201d;</p><p>He jerked his head towards the entrance, the long copper&#x2013;gold hair swirling about his shoulders. Fred sighed and nodded.</p><p>&#x201c;Should I have been more . . . tactful?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No, you were about right, I&#x2019;d say. He&#x2019;d smell a trap if you were all hail&#x2013;fellow&#x2013;well&#x2013;met and inviting him to sit down for a yarn and a tankard of beer with a slap on the back in good fellowship. And he&#x2019;d despise you if he thought it was genuine. Best to make it a matter of business and advantage on both sides.&#x201d;</p><p>The king and his ally were both big young men only a year apart in age, with similar broad&#x2013;shouldered, long&#x2013;limbed builds, both with the smooth graceful movements of those raised to the sword and the tensile wariness of those who&#x2019;d also lived by it in lands beyond law. In other ways they differed. The younger son of Boise&#x2019;s first ruler had bluntly handsome broad features and skin of a pale toast color, legacy of his sire&#x2019;s part&#x2013;African blood.</p><p>&#x201c;Well, it is to our mutual advantage,&#x201d; Fred said. &#x201c;And he does have <i>some</i> virtues. He&#x2019;s smart enough to treat his men well enough that they&#x2019;ll follow him. Especially now that he&#x2019;s leading them in the direction they want to go.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That always makes it easier, to be sure,&#x201d; Rudi said.</p><p>The High King&#x2019;s eyes were a changeable blue&#x2013;green&#x2013;gray, brighter by contrast now as the setting sun turned the big command tent into a cave of umber gloom. He wore the pleated kilt of a Mackenzie in the Clan&#x2019;s green&#x2013;brown tartan, with a plaid pinned at his shoulder over a loose&#x2013;sleeved saffron&#x2013;colored linen shirt cinched at wrists and throat with drawstrings.</p><p>A sword hung at his right side from a broad belt, in shape a knight&#x2019;s long cut&#x2013;and&#x2013;thrust weapon with a shallow&#x2013;curved crescent guard and a double&#x2013;lobed hilt of black staghorn inlaid with silver knotwork. Its pommel was a globe cradled in a web of antlers, at first glance a perfect sphere of moon&#x2013;opal. Then if you looked closer it was like crystal, and within it curves that drew the vision deeper and deeper&#x2014;</p><p>Fred&#x2019;s eyes flicked aside from it, though he ...</p></p><h2>Mani : Travels in the Southern Peloponnese</h2><p>This is Patrick Leigh Fermor's spellbinding part-travelogue, part inspired evocation of a part of Greece's past.

The angels screamed in their torment, and their burning brought brightness to the shadows for the first time. The lowest of them cowered in the depths, and there they created their own world in which to dwell.<br> <br>As the last angel fell, he looked to heaven and saw all that was to be denied him for eternity, and the vision was so terrible to him that it burned itself upon his eyes. And so, as the skies closed above him, it was given to him to witness the face of God disappear among gray clouds, and the beauty and sorrow of the image was imprinted forever in his memory, and upon his sight. He was cursed to walk forever as an outcast, shunned even by his own kind, for what could be more agonizing for them than to see, each time they looked in his eyes, the ghost of God flickering in the blackness of his pupils?<br> <br>And so alone was he that he tore himself in two, that he might have company in his long exile, and together these twin parts of the same being wandered the still-forming earth. In time, they were joined by a handful of the fallen who were weary of cowering in that bleak kingdom of their own creation. After all, what is hell but the eternal absence of God? To exist in a hellish state is to be denied forever the promise of hope, of redemption, of love. To those who have been forsaken, hell has no geography.<br> <br>But these angels at last grew weary of roaming throughout the desolate world without an outlet for their rage and their despair. They found a deep, dark place in which to sleep, and there they secreted themselves away and waited. And after many years, mines were dug, and tunnels lit, and the deepest and greatest of these excavations was among the Bohemian silver mines at Kutn� Hora, and it was called Kank.<br> <br>And it was said that when the mine reached its final depth, the lights carried by the miners flickered as though troubled by a breeze where no breeze could exist, and a great sighing was heard, as of souls released from their bondage. A stench of burning arose, and tunnels collapsed, trapping and killing those beneath. A storm of filth and dirt emerged, sweeping through the mine, choking and blinding all in its path. Those who survived spoke of voices in the abyss, and the beating of wings in the midst of the clouds. The storm ascended toward the main shaft, bursting forth into the night sky, and the men who saw it glimpsed a redness at its heart, as though it were all aflame.<br> <br>And the rebel angels took upon themselves the appearance of men, and set about creating a kingdom that they might rule through stealth and the corrupted will of others. They were led by the twin demons, the greatest of their number, the Black Angels. The first, called Ashmael, immersed himself in the fires of battle, and whispered empty promises of glory into the ears of ambitious rulers. The other, called Immael, waged his own war upon the church and its leaders, the representatives upon the earth of the One who had banished his brother. He gloried in fire and rape, and his shadow fell upon the sacking of monasteries and the burning of chapels. Each half of this twin being bore the mark of God as a white mote in his eye, Ashmael in his right eye and Immael in his left.<br> <br>But in his arrogance and wrath, Immael allowed himself to be glimpsed for a moment in his true, blighted form. He was confronted by a Cistercian monk named Erdric from the monastery at Sedlec, and they fought above vats of molten silver in a great foundry. At last, Immael was cast down, caught in the moment of transformation from human to Other, and he fell into the hot ore. Erdric called for the metal to be slowly cooled, and Immael was trapped in silver, powerless to free himself from this purest of prisons.<br> <br>And Ashmael felt his pain, and sought to free him, but the monks hid Immael well, and kept him from those who would release him from his bonds. Yet Ashmael never stopped seeking his brother, and in time he was joined in his search by those who shared his nature, and by men corrupted by his promises. They marked themselves so that they might be known to one another, and their mark was a grapnel, a forked hook, for in the old lore this was the first weapon of the fallen angels.<br> <br>And they called themselves &#x201c;Believers.&#x201d;|The Black Angel CHAPTER<p></p> I<p></p> <br>The woman stepped carefully from the Greyhound bus, her right hand holding firmly on to the bar as she eased herself down. A relieved sigh escaped from her lips once both feet were on level ground, the relief that she always felt when a simple task was negotiated without incident. She was not old&#x2014;she was barely into her fifties&#x2014;but she looked, and felt, much older. She had endured a great deal, and accumulated sorrows had intensified the predations of the years. Her hair was silver-gray, and she had long since ceased making the monthly trek to the salon to have its color altered. There were horizontal lines stretching from the corner of each eye, like healed wounds, paralleled by similar lines on her forehead. She knew how she had come by them, for occasionally she caught herself wincing as if in pain while she looked in the mirror or saw herself reflected in the window of a store, and the depth of those lines increased with the transformation in her expression. It was always the same thoughts, the same memories, that caused the change, and always the same faces that she recalled: the boy, now a man; her daughter, as she once was and as she now might be; and the one who had made her little girl upon her, his face sometimes contorted, as it was at the moment of her daughter&#x2019;s conception, and at other times tattered and destroyed, as it was before they closed the coffin lid upon him, erasing at last his physical presence from the world.<br> <br>Nothing, she had come to realize, will age a woman faster than a troubled child. In recent years, she had become prone to the kind of accidents that bedeviled the lives of women two or three decades older than she, and took longer to recover from them than once she had. It was the little things that she had to look out for: unanticipated curbs, neglected cracks in the sidewalk, the unexpected jolting of a bus as she rose from her seat, the forgotten water spilled upon the kitchen floor. She feared these things more than she feared the young men who congregated in the parking lot of the strip mall near her home, watching for the vulnerable, for those whom they considered easy prey. She knew that she would never be one of their victims, as they were more afraid of her than they were of the police, or of their more vicious peers, for they knew of the man who waited in the shadows of her life. A small part of her hated the fact that they feared her, even as she enjoyed the protection that it brought. Her protection was hard bought, purchased, she believed, with the loss of a soul.<br> <br>She prayed for him, sometimes. While the others wailed &#x201c;Hallelujah&#x201d; to the preacher, beating their breasts and shaking their heads, she remained silent, her chin to her chest, and pleaded softly. In the past, a long time ago, she would ask the Lord that her nephew might turn again to His radiant light and embrace the salvation that lay only in relinquishing violent ways. Now she no longer wished for miracles. Instead, as she thought about him, she begged God that, when this lost sheep at last stood before Him for the final judgment, He would be merciful and forgive him his trespasses; that He would look closely at the life he had lived and find within it those little acts of decency that might enable Him to offer succor to this sinner.<br> <br>But perhaps there were some lives that could never be redeemed, and some sins so terrible that they were beyond forgiveness. The preacher said that the Lord forgives all, but only if the sinner truly acknowledges his fault and seeks another path. If this was true, then she feared that her prayers would count for nothing, and he was damned to eternity.<br> <br>She showed her ticket to the man unloading the baggage from the bus. He was gruff and unfriendly to her, but he appeared to be that way to everyone. Young men and women hovered watchfully at the periphery of the light from the bus&#x2019;s windows, like wild animals fearful of the fire yet hungry for those who lay within the circle of its warmth. Her handbag gripped to her chest, she took her case by its handle and wheeled it toward the escalator. She watched those around her, heedful of the warnings of her neighbors back home.<br> <br>Don&#x2019;t accept no offers of help. Don&#x2019;t be talking to nobody seems like he just offerin&#x2019; to assist a lady with her bag, don&#x2019;t matter how well he dressed or how sweetly he sings. . . .<br> <br>But there were no offers of help, and she ascended without incident to the busy streets of this alien city, as foreign to her as Cairo or Rome might have been, dirty and crowded and unforgiving. She had scribbled an address on a piece of paper, along with the directions she had painstakingly transcribed over the phone from the man at the hotel, hearing the impatience in his voice as he was forced to repeat the address, the name of the hotel near incomprehensible to her when spoken in his thick immigrant accent.<br> <br>She walked the streets, pulling her bag behind her. She carefully noted the numbers at the intersections, trying to take as few turns as possible, until she came to the big police building. There she waited for another hour, until at last a policeman came to talk to her. He had a thin file in front of him, but she could add nothing to what she had told him over the phone, and he could tell her only that they were doing what they could. Still, she filled out more papers, in the hope that some small detail she provided might lead them to her daughter, then left and hailed a cab on the street. She passed the piece of paper with the address of her hotel through a small hole in the Plexiglas screen. She asked the driver how much it would cost to go there, and he shrugged. He was an Asian man, and he did not look pleased to see the scribbled destination.<br> <br>&#x201c;Traffic. Who knows?&#x201d;<br> <br>He waved a hand at the slow-moving streams of cars and trucks and buses. Horns honked loudly, and drivers shouted angrily at one another. All was impatience and frustration, overshadowed by buildings that were too high, out of scale with those who were expected to live and work inside and outside them. She could not understand how anyone would choose to remain in such a place.<br> <br>&#x201c;Twenty, maybe,&#x201d; said the cabdriver.<br> <br>She hoped it would be less than twenty. Twenty dollars was a lot, and she did not know how long she would have to stay here. She had booked the hotel room for three days, and had sufficient funds to cover another three days after that, as long as she ate cheaply and could master the intricacies of the subway. She had read about it, but had never seen it in reality and had no concept of its operations. She knew only that she did not like the thought of descending beneath the earth, into the darkness, but she could not afford to take cabs all the time. Buses might be better. At least they stayed aboveground, slowly though they seemed to move in this city.<br> <br>He might offer her money, of course, once she found him, but she would refuse any such offer, just as she had always refused it, carefully returning the checks that he sent to the only contact address that she had for him. His money was tainted, just as he was tainted, but she needed his help now: not his money, but his knowledge. Something terrible had happened to her daughter, of that she was certain, even if she could not explain how she knew.<br> <br>Alice, oh Alice, why did you have to come to this place?<br> <br>Her own mother had been blessed, or cursed, with the gift. She knew when someone was suffering, and could sense when harm had come to anyone who was dear to her. The dead talked to her. They told her things. Her life was filled with whispers. The gift had not been passed on, and for that the woman was grateful, but she wondered sometimes if a faint trace of it had not found its way into her, a mere spark of the great power that had dwelt in her mother. Or perhaps all mothers were cursed with the ability to sense their children&#x2019;s deepest sufferings, even when they were far, far from them. All that she could say for sure was that she had not known a moment&#x2019;s peace in recent days, and that she heard her daughter&#x2019;s voice calling to her when sleep fleetingly came.<br> <br>She would tell that to him when she met him, in the hope that he would understand. Even if he did not, she knew that he would help, for the girl was blood to him.<br> <br>And if there is one thing that he understood, it was blood.<br> <br>I PARKED IN AN alleyway about fifty feet from the house, then covered the rest of the distance on foot. I could see Jackie Garner hunched behind the wall bordering the property. He wore a black wool hat, a black jacket, and black jeans. His hands were uncovered, and his breath formed phantoms in the air. Beneath his jacket I made out the word SYLVIA written on his T-shirt.<br> <br>&#x201c;New girlfriend?&#x201d; I said.<br> <br>Jackie pulled open his jacket so I could see the T-shirt more clearly. It read, TIM &#x2018;THE MAINE-IAC&#x2019; SYLVIA, a reference to one of our local-boys-made-good, and featured a poor caricature of the great man himself. In September 2002, Tim Sylvia, all six-eight and 260 pounds of him, became the first Mainer to compete in the Ultimate Fighting Championship, eventually going on to take the Heavyweight Championship title in Las Vegas in 2003, knocking down the undefeated champion, Ricco Rodriguez, with a right cross in the first round. &#x201c;I hit him hahd,&#x201d; Sylvia told a postmatch interviewer, making every Down-Easter with flattened vowel sounds feel instantly proud. Unfortunately, Sylvia tested positive for anabolic steroids after his first defense, against the six-eleven Gan &#x201c;The Giant&#x201d; McGee, and voluntarily surrendered his belt and title. I remembered Jackie telling me once that he&#x2019;d attended the fight. Some of McGee&#x2019;s blood had landed on his jeans, and he now saved them for special wear.<br> <br>&#x201c;Nice,&#x201d; I said.<br> <br>&#x201c;I got a friend who makes them. I can let you have some cheap.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I wouldn&#x2019;t take them any other way. In fact, I wouldn&#x2019;t take them at all.&#x201d;<br> <br>Jackie was offended. For a guy who might have passed for Tim Sylvia&#x2019;s out-of-condition older brother, he was pretty sensitive.<br> <br>&#x201c;How many are there in the house?&#x201d; I asked, but his attention had already wandered on to another subject.<br> <br>&#x201c;Hey, we&#x2019;re dressed the same,&#x201d; he said.<br> <br>&#x201c;What?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re dressed the same. Look: you got the hat, the same jacket, the jeans. Except you got gloves and I got this T-shirt, we could be twins.&#x201d;<br> <br>Jackie Garner was a good guy, but I thought that he might be a little crazy. Someone once told me that a shell accidentally went off close to him when he was serving with the U.S. Army in Berlin just before the Wall came down. He was unconscious for a week, and for six months after he awoke he couldn&#x2019;t remember anything that happened later than 1983. Even though he was mostly recovered, there were still gaps in his memory, and he occasionally confused the guys at Bull Moose Music by asking for &#x201c;new&#x201d; CDs that were actually fifteen years old.

That was better; now it was just the comforting pressure of the inner-skirt holster, tucked away underneath my short royal blue suit jacket. I&#x2019;d stopped wearing my shoulder holster except when I was on an active warrant as a U.S. Marshal. When I was working at Animators Inc. and seeing clients, the behind-the-back holster was less likely to flash and make them nervous. You&#x2019;d think if someone was asking me to raise the dead for them that they&#x2019;d have better nerves, but guns seemed to scare them a lot more than talking about zombies. It was different once the zombie was raised and they were looking at the walking dead; then suddenly the guns didn&#x2019;t bother them nearly as much, but until that Halloweenesque moment I tried to keep the weapons out of sight. There was a knock on my office door and Mary, our daytime receptionist, opened it without my saying <i>Come in</i>, which she&#x2019;d never done in the six years we&#x2019;d been working together, so I wasn&#x2019;t grumpy about the interruption. I just looked up from double-checking my client meetings to make sure there wouldn&#x2019;t be any overlap issues, and knew something was up, and knowing Mary it would be important. She was like that.</p><p>She&#x2019;d finally let her hair go gray, but it was still in the same obviously artificial hairdo that it had always been. She&#x2019;d let herself get a little plump as she neared sixty and had finally embraced glasses full time. The combination of it all had aged her about ten years, but she seemed happy with it, saying, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m a grandma; I&#x2019;m okay looking like one.&#x201d; The look on her face was sad and set in sympathetic lines. It was the face she used to deal with grieving families who wanted their loved ones raised from the dead. Having that face aimed at me sped my pulse and tightened my stomach.</p><p>I made myself take a deep breath and let it out slow as Mary closed the door behind her and started walking toward my desk. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s wrong?&#x201d; I asked.</p><p>&#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t want to tell you over the phone with all the clients listening,&#x201d; she said.</p><p>&#x201c;Tell me what?&#x201d; I asked, and fought the urge not to raise my voice. She was about one more uninformative answer away from getting yelled at.</p><p>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s a woman on line two, she says she&#x2019;s your future mother-in-law. I told her you weren&#x2019;t engaged to my knowledge, and she said that she didn&#x2019;t know what to call herself since you were just living with her son.&#x201d;</p><p>I was actually living with several men, but most of them didn&#x2019;t have families to use words like son. &#x201c;Name, Mary, what&#x2019;s her name?&#x201d; My voice was rising a little.</p><p>&#x201c;Morgan, Beatrice Morgan.&#x201d;</p><p>I frowned at her. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not living with anyone named Morgan. I&#x2019;ve never even dated anyone with that last name.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t recognize it from your boyfriends, but she said that the father is hurt, maybe dying, and she thought he&#x2019;d want to know about his dad before it was too late. The emotion is real, Anita. I&#x2019;m sorry, maybe she&#x2019;s crazy, but sometimes people don&#x2019;t think clearly when their husband is hurt. I didn&#x2019;t want to just write her off as crazy; I mean, I don&#x2019;t know the last name of everyone you&#x2019;re dating.&#x201d;</p><p>I started to tell her to ignore the call, but looking into Mary&#x2019;s face I couldn&#x2019;t do it. I&#x2019;d trusted her to screen callers for years. She had a good feel for distraught versus crazy. &#x201c;She give a first name for her son?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Mike.&#x201d;</p><p>I shook my head. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve never dated a Mike Morgan. I don&#x2019;t know why she called here, but she&#x2019;s got the wrong Anita Blake.&#x201d;</p><p>Mary nodded, but her expression looked unhappy. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll tell her that you don&#x2019;t know a Mike Morgan.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Do that. She&#x2019;s either got the wrong Anita Blake, or she&#x2019;s crazy.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;She doesn&#x2019;t sound crazy, just upset.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You know that crazy doesn&#x2019;t mean the emotion isn&#x2019;t real, Mary. Sometimes the delusion is so real they believe it all.&#x201d;</p><p>Mary nodded again and went out to tell Beatrice Morgan she had the wrong number. I went back to checking the last of my client meetings. I wanted to make sure that no matter how long it took to raise each zombie, I wouldn&#x2019;t be too late for the next cemetery. Clients tended to get spooked if you left them hanging out in graveyards too long by themselves. At least most of the meetings were historical societies and lawyers checking wills, with the families of the deceased either long dead or not allowed near the zombie until after the will was settled in case just seeing the loved ones influenced the zombie to change its mind about the last will and testament. I wasn&#x2019;t sure it was possible to sway a zombie that way, but I approved of the new court ruling that families couldn&#x2019;t see the deceased until after all court matters were cleared up, just in case. Have one billionaire inheritance overturned because of undue influence on a zombie and everybody got all weird about it.</p><br><br><p>Mary came through the door without knocking, &#x201c;Micah. Mike was his nickname as a kid. Morgan is her name from her second marriage. It was Callahan. Micah Callahan&#x2019;s mother is on line two, and his dad is in the hospital.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Shit!&#x201d; I said, picking up the phone and hitting the button to put the call through. &#x201c;Mrs. Callahan, I mean, Mrs. Morgan, this is Anita Blake.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, thank God, I&#x2019;m so sorry. I just forgot about the names. I&#x2019;ve been Beatrice Morgan for eighteen years, since Micah was twelve, and he was Mike to us. He didn&#x2019;t like <i>Micah</i> when he was a little boy. He thought <i>Mike</i> was more grown up.&#x201d; She was crying softly, I could hear it in her voice, but her words were clear, well enunciated. It made me wonder what she did for a living, but I didn&#x2019;t ask. It could wait; it was just one of the thoughts you have when you&#x2019;re trying not to get caught up in the emotions of a situation. Think, don&#x2019;t feel, just think.</p><p>&#x201c;You told our receptionist that Micah&#x2019;s dad was hurt.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, Rush, that&#x2019;s my ex, his father, was attacked by something. His deputy said it was a zombie, but the bite isn&#x2019;t human, and it&#x2019;s like he&#x2019;s infected with something from it.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Zombies rarely attack people.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I know that!&#x201d; She yelled it. I heard her taking deep breaths, drawing in her calm. I heard the effort over the phone, could almost feel her gathering herself back. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry, but when Mike left us he was so horrible, but Rush said he&#x2019;d found out that Mike did it to protect all of us, and that some of the people had their families hurt by these people.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What people?&#x201d; I asked.</p><p>&#x201c;Rush wouldn&#x2019;t tell me details, said it was a police matter. He was always doing that when we were married, drove me nuts, but he said that he&#x2019;d found out enough to know that other wereanimals in that group had their families killed, and Mike had to convince them he hated us, or they would have hurt us. Do you know if that&#x2019;s true? Does Mike want to see his father? Does he want to see any of us?&#x201d; She was crying again, and just stopped trying to talk. She hadn&#x2019;t been married to the man for nearly twenty years, and she was still this upset. Crap.</p><p>I was remembering that Micah&#x2019;s dad was a sheriff of some flavor, and now his mom was telling me that somehow the dad had found out more about Micah and his animal group than I thought anyone with a badge, besides me, knew. I&#x2019;d had to kill people to rescue Micah and his group, and I hadn&#x2019;t had a warrant of execution, so it was murder. I was a little leery that Sheriff Callahan apparently knew more about it all than I&#x2019;d thought. I knew that Micah hadn&#x2019;t talked to his family in years, so how had his dad found out, and how much did he know?</p><p>It was my turn to take a deep breath and make myself stop being so damn paranoid and deal with the crying woman on the other end of the phone. &#x201c;Mrs. Morgan, Mrs. Morgan, how did you know to call here? Who gave you this number?&#x201d; Maybe if I made her think about something more ordinary she&#x2019;d calm down.</p><p>She sniffled, and then said, in a voice that was hiccupy, as she tried to swallow past the emotion, &#x201c;We saw Mike in the news as the head of the Coalition.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The Coalition for Better Understanding between humans and shapeshifters,&#x201d; I said.</p><p>&#x201c;Yes&#x201d;&#x2014;and the word was calmer&#x2014;&#x201c;yes, and you were mentioned in several stories as living with him.&#x201d;</p><p>I wondered if the stories had talked about Nathaniel, the guy who lived with us, or the fact that I was also &#x201c;dating&#x201d; Jean-Claude, the Master Vampire of St. Louis? I almost never watched the news, so I didn&#x2019;t always know what was being said in the media about any of us.</p><p>&#x201c;Why didn&#x2019;t you call the Coalition number and ask for Micah directly?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;He said really awful things to me last time we spoke, Ms. Blake. I think I&#x2019;d fall completely apart if he said that again to me with Rush hurt like this. Can you please tell him, and then if Mike wants to see us, to see Rush, before . . . in time . . . I mean . . . Oh, God, I&#x2019;m usually better than this, but it&#x2019;s so terrible what&#x2019;s happening to Rush, so hard to watch.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Happening? What do you mean?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s rotting . . . he&#x2019;s rotting alive and aware and the doctors can&#x2019;t stop it. They have drugs that can slow it, but nothing slows it down much.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry, I don&#x2019;t understand. You mean that something preternatural attacked Mr. Callahan and now he&#x2019;s got some disease?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; she said, almost a breath rather than a word.</p><p>&#x201c;But they&#x2019;ve seen it before, this disease?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, they say it&#x2019;s the first case outside the East Coast, but they&#x2019;ve learned enough to slow it down. There&#x2019;s no cure, though. I overheard a nurse call it the zombie disease, but she got in trouble for saying it. The older nurse said, &#x2018;Don&#x2019;t give it a name that the media will love.&#x2019; I heard doctors whispering that it&#x2019;s just a matter of time before it hits the news.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Why do they call it the zombie disease?&#x201d; I asked, partly to just give myself time to think.</p><p>&#x201c;You rot from the outside in, so you&#x2019;re aware the whole time. Apparently it&#x2019;s incredibly quick, and they&#x2019;ve only managed to prolong the life of one other person.&#x201d; Her breath came out in a shudder.</p><p>&#x201c;Mrs. Morgan, there are questions I want to ask, but I&#x2019;m afraid they&#x2019;ll upset you more.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Ask, just ask,&#x201d; she said.</p><p>I took in a deep breath, let it out slow, and finally said, &#x201c;You said prolong. For how long?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Five days.&#x201d;</p><p><i>Shit</i>, I thought. Out loud I said, &#x201c;Give me an address, phone numbers, and I&#x2019;ll tell Micah.&#x201d; I started to promise we&#x2019;d be there, but I couldn&#x2019;t promise for him. He&#x2019;d been estranged from his family for about ten years. Just because I&#x2019;d have gotten on a plane for my semi-estranged family didn&#x2019;t mean he&#x2019;d do the same. I took all the information down as if I were sure of his answer.</p><p>&#x201c;Thank you, thank you so much. I knew it was the right thing to do to call another woman. We manage the men so much more than they think, don&#x2019;t we?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Actually Micah manages me more than the other way around.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, is it because you&#x2019;re police like Rush? Is it more about the badge than being a man?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I think so,&#x201d; I said.</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ll bring Micah?&#x201d;</p><p>I didn&#x2019;t want to lie to her, but I wasn&#x2019;t sure the absolute truth was anything she could handle; she needed something to hang on to, to look forward to while she sat and watched her ex-husband rot while still alive. Jesus, Mary, and Joseph, just thinking it was terrible. I couldn&#x2019;t leave her to watch it with no hope, so I lied.</p><p>&#x201c;Of course,&#x201d; I said.</p><p>&#x201c;See, I&#x2019;m right, you just say you&#x2019;ll bring him. You manage him more than you think.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Maybe so, Mrs. Morgan, maybe so.&#x201d;</p><p>She sounded calmer as she said, &#x201c;Beatrice, Bea, to my friends. Bring my son home, Anita, please.&#x201d;</p><p>What could I say? &#x201c;I will . . . Bea.&#x201d;</p><p>I hung up, hoping I hadn&#x2019;t lied to her.</p></p><h2>It&#39;s Not Easy Being Green: And Other Things to Consider</h2><p>&#x201c;The words say 'It&#x2019;s not easy being green,' but the song is about knowing who you are. And in it you hear Jim&#x2019;s message most clearly. He believed that people are good and that they want to do their best and that no matter how or why we might be different from anybody else, we should learn to love who we are and be proud of it.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;Ray Charles<br><br>In the tradition of <i>The World According to Mister Rogers</i>, a timeless collection of wisdom on life, friendship, individuality, creativity, collaboration, and more -- from Jim Henson and Friends<br><br>There are few things that evoke such a universal feeling of warmth and humor as the work of Jim Henson. In his own words, as well as those of some of his best-known characters like Kermit the Frog and Ernie, we get a glimpse of the philosophy and humor that was so essential to Jim's creations. We also get a behind-the-scenes glimpse of the collaborative spirit of this gentle artistic genius from the people Jim knew, loved, and inspired. <br><br>This uplifting collection of quotes, stories, anecdotes, songs, and insights gives new life to Jim's magical world. With chapters titled Dynamite Determination; Listen to Your Heart; Together We Can Do It; It Starts When We're Kids; and A Part of Everything and Everyone, <i>It's Not Easy Being Green</i> is by turns entertaining, inspiring, and laugh-out-loud funny, reminding us that every day counts. Readers young and old will cherish this collection. <br><br>Culled from The Jim Henson Company archives, program transcripts, personal letters, and interviews, along with some of Jim's never-before-published writings, <i>It's Not Easy Being Green</i> is a testament to the legacy of a man who changed the way we see the world.</p><p><strong>Jim Henson</strong> first started his career on a local TV show <em>Sam and Friends</em> in Washington D.C in 1958. In 1969, he formed the core of the children's program,<em>Sesame Street,</em> which continues to air today and has been shown in more than a hundred countries around the world. Henson's creations were soon seen on<em>The Muppet Show,</em> which aired in 1976 through 1981 and later on <em>Fraggle Rock, Jim Henson's Muppet Babies</em>, and Jim Henson's<em>The Storyteller.</em> The Muppets moved to star in six feature films: <em>The Muppet Movie, The Great Muppet Caper, The Muppets Take Manhattan, The Muppet Christmas Carol, Muppet Treasure Island,</em> and<em>Muppets From Space</em>. In addition to making Muppet movies, Henson also brought two remarkably original fantasy films to the big screen,<em>The Dark Crystal</em> and<em> Labyrinth</em>. Henson died in May of 1990, survived by his wife and five children.Anyone familiar with American culture will recognize something in this collection of songs, quotations, and stories. However, despite the graceful and loving deliveries of John Lithgow, Whoopi Goldberg, and Jerry Nelson, the experience may be a bit disorienting--you just don't expect anyone except a Muppet to deliver Jim Henson's lines. That said, the lines and songs can stand alone and will spark pleasant memories. While young listeners may not be interested in some of the stories about Henson, these selections are brief, and the explanations of Henson's goals (and songs) will lead easily to useful opportunities for teaching.

The &#34;Ryrie Study Bible&#34; is especially designed to help you achieve that goal. Every time you read this Bible, whether carefully or casually, be sure to look at the notes at the bottom of the page. These are designed to illuminate and help you understand the verses you are reading. The notes provide a variety of helps: some furnish historical or archaeological background; others translate or interpret the text more clearly; some define words and doctrines; and many refer you to other passages which relate to the same subject. When you wish to study a book of the Bible more systematically, you will want to read the Introduction to that book, which will give you information about the author, background, and contents. A unique feature of this Bible is the outline of each book printed at the end of each Introduction and also interspersed throughout the text. In this way you can readily see as you are reading through a book exactly where you are in the development of the ideas of that book by simply referring to the complete outline in the Introduction. The Introductions will help lead you into the messages of the books; the outlines will help you see the development of the messages; and the notes will help shed light on the messages. In addition, you will find at the back of the Bible an index of the principal subjects treated in the notes. There is also a Harmony of the Gospels for use when you want to locate the several accounts of an event in the Gospels.</p><p></p><h2>Blood and Banquets: A Berlin Social Diary</h2><p>The diary, smuggled out of Nazi Germany, of a Jewish woman who wrote the social column for a major Berlin newspaper, and was able to observe the rise of the Nazis</p><p>As a Berlin social reporter in the years leading up to WWII, Bella Fromm mingled with some of the most important and influential members of Hitler's rising Third Reich. Given the Nazis' appreciation for propaganda, this fact alone would be unremarkable, but her writings take on special interest when coupled with the knowledge that she received such access while openly proclaiming her own Jewish background and anti-Nazi sympathies. As she dutifully reported on the countless dinners, galas, and cultural events attended by German high society, Fromm also kept a secret diary that chronicled the seemingly inexplicable growth and horrifying consequences of National Socialism: "It's not curious that all this is beginning to make me feel like a stranger in my own country, that I am beginning to be aware of a feeling of hostility...."<p> Fearing for her life, Fromm fled Germany in 1938, smuggling her incriminating diary out in separate parcels before she left. First published in 1943, these recollections wear the patina of an Allied effort at public relations, but the prescient accuracy of her dire predictions is intriguing nonetheless. And, while invariably placing herself in the shining glow of absolute moral and ethical integrity, her insightful observations offer an interesting record of the many actions--both heroic and cowardly--she witnessed during this particularly ugly period of mass hysteria. <i>--George Laney</i></p></p><h2>Chapter House Dune</h2><p>The long-established galactic order is passing.

Hofstadter make this 320-page, breathtaking collection the definitive book of optical illusions.</b> <br><br>Rings of seahorses that seem to rotate on the page. Butterflies that transform right before your eyes into two warriors with their horses. A mosaic portrait of oceanographer Jacques Cousteau made from seashells. These dazzling and often playful artistic creations manipulate perspective so cleverly that they simply outwit our brains: we can&#x2019;t just take a quick glance and turn away. They compel us to look once, twice, and over and over again, as we try to figure out exactly how the delightful trickery manages to fool our perceptions so completely.

She was a stewardess for first-class passengers on the Titanic and she wrote an absolutley unique eyewitness account on the ost written about disaster of our time. Four years later, Violet was a nurse onboard the hospital ship BRitannic when it struck a mine and sank to the bottom of the Aegean. But Titanic Survivor is much more. A unique autobiography for those who want to know how it really felt, a story that could be told only by a Titanic Survivor.</p><p>The photos in Violet Jessop's moving memoir reveal her to have been still lovelier than <i>Titanic</i> star Kate Winslet, but that only made her job harder as a stewardess aboard the ship. As reported by John Maxtone-Graham, Jessop's beauty no doubt increased her troubles with the "philandering captains and pursers, loquacious or insufferable fellow stewardesses, and an array of sometimes horrifying passengers."<p> But Jessop had no problem dishing the dirt on all aboard, the liveliest being her fellow steward Tim Nolan. "He had the appearance of a venerable archdeacon, the contrariness of the Irish, the rosy face of a child, and the soul of a vagabond," she reports. "It would take a mathematician to keep count of the resolutions made and broken by Tim to refrain from 'a drop of cheer' during one Atlantic crossing." Nolan had to stash his drops of cheer in rich folks' cabins, once being forced to hide under an occupied bed all day in a scene worthy of the Marx brothers. "Sure, wasn't I afraid I was going to sneeze every time I took a breath? It's me that'll be sober from now on," vowed Nolan.</p><p> Nolan's encounter with a stuffed mermaid and a flesh-and-blood circus freak named the Bear Woman really freaked him out. "It took several people to convince Tim he was not still 'under the influence' and 'seeing things,'" Jessop writes. "The combination of the mermaid (he could not forget her placid expression and dainty arms) and the Bear Woman did a lot towards keeping Tim on the water wagon."</p><p> Jessop's account of her last conversation with another colleague, Stan, who saved her life by ordering her to hustle up to the lifeboat that his sex disqualified him from boarding, is touching. They argued about her clothes. "I said as he brought forth my new spring outfit, all trimmings and things," writes Jessop, "'That's no rig for a shipwreck, all fussed up and gay.' Suddenly, I was trying to be jocular, afraid I might cry ... 'So long, Stan. Come up yourself soon, won't you?' He was standing with his arm clasped behind him in the corner ... He suddenly looked very tired. Good old, ugly-faced, big-hearted Stanley!"</p><p> Good old, pretty-faced, big-hearted Violet. It's a good thing you wrote it all down. <i>--Tim Appelo</i></p>At the age of 21, Violet Jessop joined the Orinoco in 1908. Save for wartime spells ashore, she served as a cabin stewardess until her retirement forty-two years later. She lived a life of uncommon travel and adventure.

D. Salinger. She spends her days in a plush, wood-paneled office, where Dictaphones and typewriters still reign and old-time agents doze at their desks after martini lunches. At night she goes home to the tiny, threadbare Williamsburg apartment she shares with her socialist boyfriend. Precariously balanced between glamour and poverty, surrounded by titanic personalities, and struggling to trust her own artistic instinct, Rakoff is tasked with answering Salinger&#x2019;s voluminous fan mail. But as she reads the candid, heart-wrenching letters from his readers around the world, she finds herself unable to type out the agency&#x2019;s decades-old form response. Instead, drawn inexorably into the emotional world of Salinger&#x2019;s devotees, she abandons the template and begins writing back. Over the course of the year, she finds her own voice by acting as Salinger&#x2019;s, on her own dangerous and liberating terms. <br><br> Rakoff paints a vibrant portrait of a bright, hungry young woman navigating a heady and longed-for world, trying to square romantic aspirations with burgeoning self-awareness, the idea of a life with life itself. Charming and deeply moving, filled with electrifying glimpses of an American literary icon, <i>My Salinger Year</i> is the coming-of-age story of a talented writer. Above all, it is a testament to the universal power of books to shape our lives and awaken our true selves.</p><p><p><strong>An Amazon Best Book of the Month, June 2014:</strong> Once upon a time, not so very long ago, there existed a world in which writers used typewriters, publishers and agents sent manuscripts (on paper!) via the U.S. Postal Service, and starry-eyed ambitious young people moved to New York to try their luck in the literary world. (Okay, so that last bit still holds true.) It was the late &#x2018;90s when writer-to-be Joanna Rakoff got her first job in New York publishing as an assistant to the woman who represented the great reclusive author J.D. Salinger. In the winsome and meticulously observed <em>My Salinger Year</em>, Rakoff recounts her experiences as an earlier-era Lena Dunham-creation, complete with a ratty Brooklyn apartment, strident anti-establishment boyfriend, and big, <em>big</em> dreams. &#x201c;We all have to start somewhere,&#x201d; is how Rakoff begins her story of being young, gifted, and possessed of a coveted &#x201c;editorial assistant&#x201d; job that her parents (my parents, your parents, everyone&#x2019;s parents) would call &#x201c;secretary.&#x201d; While it&#x2019;s true that J.D. &#x201c;Jerry&#x201d; Salinger figures into the narrative--and rather sympathetically so--it&#x2019;s a mistake to say he&#x2019;s at the heart of it. Youth, adventure, hope, ambition, and a keen eye and ear are what make this book run; with it, Rakoff--author of the novel <em>A Fortunate Age</em>--takes her place among such illustrious coming-of-age-in-New-York writers as Sylvia Plath, Candace Bushnell, and, well, maybe even J.D. Salinger. <em>--Sara Nelson</em></p>Joanna Rakoff&#x2019;s novel&nbsp;<i>A Fortunate Age</i>&nbsp;won the Goldberg Prize for Jewish Fiction by Emerging Writers and the <i>Elle</i> Readers&#x2019; Prize, and was a&nbsp;<i>New York Times</i>&nbsp;Editors&#x2019; Choice and a&nbsp;<i>San Francisco Chronicle</i>&nbsp;best seller.

This beautiful book, with more than 100 instructive illustrations, is revolutionary in its approach because: <br><br>� it leads the cook infallibly from the buying and handling of raw ingredients, through each essential step of a recipe, to the final creation of a delicate confection; <br><br>� it breaks down the classic cuisine into a logical sequence of themes and variations rather than presenting an endless and diffuse catalogue of recipes; the focus is on key recipes that form the backbone of French cookery and lend themselves to an infinite number of elaborations&#x2014;bound to increase anyone&#x2019;s culinary repertoire; <br><br>� it adapts classical techniques, wherever possible, to modern American conveniences; <br><br>� it shows Americans how to buy products, from any supermarket in the United States, that reproduce the exact taste and texture of the French ingredients, for example, equivalent meat cuts, the right beans for a cassoulet, or the appropriate fish and seafood for a bouillabaisse; <br><br>� it offers suggestions for just the right accompaniment to each dish, including proper wines. Since there has never been a book as instructive and as workable as <em>Mastering the Art of French Cooking</em>, the techniques learned here can be applied to recipes in all other French cookbooks, making them infinitely more usable.

With an attention to detail developed through years of teaching, he explains how to make the perfect accompaniments to a cup of coffee, as well as spectacular endings to elegant meals.<br><br>Filled with food facts and lore (from when coffee first came to Vienna to the great Sachertorte controversy), Kaffeehaus is a treat for armchair travelers and cooks alike.</p><p>Reading Rick Rodgers's <i>Kaffeehaus</i> is like strolling through the streets of three of the world's most romantic cities--Vienna, Budapest, and Prague--where the coffeehouse is the center of the universe and that little something sweet to go with your afternoon cup is considered high art. Eleven chapters on subjects ranging from "Sweet Yeast Breads" to "Strudels" and "Sweet Dumplings and Noodles" cover the gamut of sweets you're likely to find in the classic <i>kaffeehauser</i>. Rodgers provides recipes for such legendary treats as chocolaty Sachertorte, flaky Sour Cherry Strudel, sugar-dusted Banana Gugelhupf, jam-filled Linzertorte, and rustic but soul-satisfying squares of Plum Cake.<p> A renowned cooking instructor and cookbook author, Rodgers has developed the patient voice and attentiveness the job requires, and these qualities shine through in his inviting recipes. Though the book focuses exclusively on the impressive desserts found in coffeehouses, rather than those that are home-baked, Rodgers has developed recipes accessible enough for recreating such scrumptious treats in any home kitchen. Filled with culinary lore--from the scandalous story of Rigo Jansci, the handsome gypsy violinist who lured an American millionairess to leave her husband for a passionate affair and inspired the sinful chocolate dessert that now bears his name, to the great Sachertorte controversy that gripped Vienna in the 1830s--<i>Kaffeehaus</i> is a treat for armchair travelers and adventurous bakers alike. <i>--Robin Donovan</i></p>Because of questions I am receiving on my website, I would like to make some things clear about this KAFFEEHAUS reprint. The 2014 version on this page has an updated cafe guide in the back matter, but no new recipes. I have also provided a complete metric measurements chart (not the usual fairly useless one with 28 g = 1 oz) with weights for uncommon ingredients like ground almonds. The Echo Point edition (with the black cover) is brand-new and freshly printed. The Clarkson Potter 2002 edition (with Esterhazytorte slice on the cover) has been out of print for about 3 years, so purchases from that book&#39;s page are all used copies, and condition is anyone&#39;s guess. So, for gift-giving a clean, fresh copy, I recommend this 2014 edition. But be advised that there are not any new recipes, and that it is essentially a pure reprint.

But few of us are fully aware of how dramatic our body's reactions to emotions can sometimes be. <br><br>Take Pauline, who first became ill when she was fifteen. What seemed at first to be a urinary infection became joint pain, then food intolerances, then life-threatening appendicitis. And then one day, after a routine operation, Pauline lost all the strength in her legs. Shortly after that her convulsions started. But Pauline's tests are normal; her symptoms seem to have no physical cause whatsoever. <br><br>Pauline may be an extreme case, but she is by no means alone. As many as a third of men and women visiting their GP have symptoms that are medically unexplained. In most, an emotional root is suspected and yet, when it comes to a diagnosis, this is the very last thing we want to hear, and the last thing doctors want to say. <br><br>In<i> It's All in Your Head</i> consultant neurologist Dr Suzanne O'Sullivan takes us on a journey through the very real world of psychosomatic illness. She takes us from the extreme -- from paralysis, seizures and blindness -- to more everyday problems such as tiredness and pain. Meeting her patients, she encourages us to look deep inside the human condition. There we find the secrets we are all capable of keeping from ourselves, and our age-old failure to credit the intimate and extraordinary connection between mind and body.</p><p><p>DR.

Reprint.</p><p>Joanna Cole and Bruce Degen, the author and illustrator of the Magic School Bus books, have collaborated for twenty years, bringing humor and true kidlike curiosity to science and learning. Booklist heralded Ms. Frizzle as &#34;the wackiest, wisest teacher in picture books.&#34; Two MSB titles have been named School Library Journal Best Books of the Year, and they have won countless state book awards, from New York to Nebraska.The planetarium is closed for repairs, so the Magic School Bus blasts off on a real tour of the solar system. After their previous field trips, the children in Ms. Frizzle's class are all blase about such things; as they land on the Moon, Venus, and Mars, and fly by the other planets and the Sun, they comment on what they see, generate a blizzard of one- or two-sentence reports on special topics and--even while Ms. Frizzle is temporarily left behind in the asteroid belt--crack terrible jokes ("Could Saturn take a bath? Yes, but it might leave a ring!"). Although some of the information is radically simplified--people are said to float in space because "without a large mass nearby . . . they do not have weight"--Cole keeps the narrative specific without burdening it with loads of facts. Degen's fresh, energetic illustrations complement the breathless pace perfectly. A first-class introduction to the planets, fine for pleasure or purpose reading. --John Peters, New York Public Library<br>Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>In a Gilded Cage (Molly Murphy Mysteries)</h2><p><p>Irish immigrant Molly Murphy and her New York City P.I. business are in the midst of a sweeping influenza epidemic and a fight for women&#x2019;s suffrage that lands her in jail.

This book is based on his lectures on the West Coast. Each lecture has an introduction and includes additional material that expands and connects the various concepts for the reader. In addition, it includes introductory chapters which introduces Muramoto and his works. <br><br> Traditional Asian medicine does not conceive of the body in parts; it considers the organ a part of the whole, and disease a deterioration of the entire body-system. Its highest practitioners reflect constantly upon the role of man in this world and the role of disease in this life. They know that our bodies are inseparable from the soil that feeds us. The earth, the plants it produces, the animals, and mankind are all interrelated. Based on its assumption that the body is an organic whole, Oriental medicine has names for only about 100 types of diseases, the others simply fall into general categories. By realizing this unity, and by briefly studying the Yin-Yang principle, we can more easily learn the methods for healing ourselves.</p><p></p><h2>Henry Ford and the Jews: The Mass Production of Hate</h2><p>Describes how Henry Ford promoted his anti-Semitic views in &#34;The Dearborn Independent&#34; and other publications and examines the response of the Jewish community in America as well as Ford&#39;s impact on the spread of anti-Semitism in Europe before World War II.</p><p>Henry Ford was not only one of America's great industrialists, he was also one of America's great haters. With "his rambling mouth" and his "volatile passions and budgetless financial resources," Ford became famous around the country and the world for his rabid anti-Semitism. "He did not like the Jews because he believed they were warmongering, manipulative, and alien," writes Neil Baldwin. A pacifist, Ford blamed the First World War on "German-Jewish bankers." In the 1920s, he published <i>The Dearborn Independent</i>, which featured notorious articles such as "The International Jew: The World's Problem." In 1938, he became the first American recipient of a Nazi award bestowed upon non-Germans. Baldwin details Ford's views and activities and also describes the phenomenon of anti-Semitism in the United States during the 1920s and 1930s. Henry Ford once declared, infamously, "History is more or less the bunk." His descendents seem to disagree. "Beginning with Henry Ford II," writes Baldwin, "succeeding generations of Fords have sought to put an end to Henry Ford's dark legacy" by supporting Israel and Jewish charities. Their actions bear out what one Jewish newspaper said in response to Ford in 1920: "We are firm in our belief that stupidity cannot triumph." <i>--John Miller</i>Neil Baldwin is the executive director of the National Book Foundation and the author of <i>Legends of the Plumed Serpent</i>, <i>Man Ray</i>, <i>To All Gentleness: William Carlos Williams</i>, and <i>Edison</i>.

At the heart of the book is Jackson's philosophy of mindful basketball -- and his lifelong quest to bring enlightenment to the competitive world of professional sports, beginning with a focus on selfless team play rather than "winning through intimidation". <b>Sacred Hoops</b> is not just for sports fans, but for anyone interested in the potential of the human spirit.<strong>Phil Jackson</strong> is an American original.

No irrelevant detail--from the length of her skirts to the thank-you notes she sent her dressmaker--escapes examination in this account of Ethel Kennedy's life. If Oppenheimer (Barbara Walters, 1990, etc.) has a point of view, it seems to be that being rich and famous is hell, and it is hell squared if you're both a Skakel and a Kennedy. A brief review of Ethel's ancestors takes the reader back to Yazoo County, Miss., and her great-grandfather, who was one of 11 children. Ethel herself was one of seven in an unruly tribe, wealthy and privileged but undisciplined. Her brothers terrorized Greenwich, Conn., with their antics, as some of Ethel's 11 children would later terrorize Hyannis Port, Mass., and Hickory Hill, Va. The young Ethel was nevertheless a good fit for the Kennedy family. Athletic, schooled by the nuns of the Sacred Heart (as were Rose and her daughters) to give husband and children priority in life, she was an exuberant, extroverted complement to the sometimes melancholy Robert F. Kennedy. She also bravely faced tragic loss--her parents, her brother, her brother-in-law, her husband, a son. But she was a notorious penny-pincher, could be vindictive and unreasonably demanding, and was given to rages after Bobby's assassination. That her flaws and her family scandals overshadow her virtues and accomplishments make this unrewarding reading. Arranging index cards in the right order does not make for enlightening biography. With her children leading relatively useful lives and with a personal history of philanthropic activism, Ethel deserves better. (16 pages b&amp;w photos, not seen) ($150,000 ad/promo) -- <i>Copyright �1994, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>Oppenheimer relentlessly chips away at the veneer of the Kennedy mystique in this gossipy, sometimes shocking biography of Ethel Skakel Kennedy (born in 1928), widow of Attorney General Robert Kennedy. Daughter of a driven, alcoholic coal magnate and a borderline-alcoholic mother, Ethel Kennedy is portrayed as an arrogant, abusive, highly erratic woman who spent her married life trying to prove herself as competitive and shrewd as the Kennedys. At the same time, she devoted considerable energy to covering up the scandals of some of her 11 children and relatives that included arson, drug addiction, even two murders. A Skakel relative allegedly killed somebody in 1958; another Skakel was one of two suspects in a 1975 murder case. Oppenheimer ( Barbara Walters: An Unauthorized Biography ) pries loose a raft of such family secrets, also drawing heavily on published accounts. With all his cataloguing of dirt, this ultimately depressing biography proves to be biased and mean-spirited.

Why do we agree on calling the beast a cat? Interesting questions, but an even more intriguing question lies at the heart of all modern philosophy-how much of our perception of things depends on our cognitive ability and how much on linguistic resources? At this point semiotics becomes inextricably linked to epistemology, or cognition. In these essays, Umberto Eco explores in depth such subjects as perception, the relationship between language and experience, and iconism that he only touched on in A Theory of Semiotics. Forgoing a formal, systematic treatment, Eco engages in a series of explorations based on common sense, from which flow an abundance of illustrative fables, often with animals as protagonists. Among the characters, a position of prominence is reserved for the platypus, which appears to have been created specifically to "put the cat among the pigeons" as far as many theories of knowledge are concerned. In Kant and the Platypus, Eco shares with us a wealth of ideas at once philosophical and amusing.<br></p><p>Describing Umberto Eco as a writer is like describing the platypus as an animal. What do readers expect when they see the author's name on a book jacket? It's a tricky question to answer, given his range and versatility: he has produced studies of semiotics, children's books, medieval history, essays on contemporary culture, and, of course, novels--most notably <i>The Name of the Rose</i> and <i>The Island of the Day Before</i>. So first, a word of warning. Anyone familiar with Eco the novelist or essayist might well be dismayed by <i>Kant and the Platypus</i>, for this new book returns to his preoccupations of the 1960s and 1970s--to semiotics and cognitive semantics. As such, it can be a daunting volume (the initial chapter, for example, riffs on the numerous philosophical concepts of being). And second, a word of encouragement: this is a wonderful engagement with the issues of language itself. Even as he beckons the reader into one linguistic thicket after another, Eco always keeps a commonsensical perspective, using stories to explicate the knottiest concepts.<p> Why did Marco Polo describe the rhinoceros as a type of unicorn? Why couldn't 18th-century observers figure out how to classify the duck-billed platypus? Given a dictionary or encyclopedia definition of a mouse, how easy would it be to identify one if we had never seen one before? These are some of the examples that Eco uses to explore the ways in which we see and describe the world--the ways, that is, in which cultures develop taxonomies. If you want to know "why we can tell an elephant from an armadillo," or why mirrors do <i>not</i> in fact reverse images, this book will tell you. In fact, it will also tell you why you know what I am talking about when I say "this book." Got it? No? Then get it. <i>--Burhan Tufail</i></p>UMBERTO ECO is the author of five novels and numerous essay collections, including <em>The Name of the Rose,</em> <em>The Prague Cemetery, </em>and <em>Inventing the Enemy. </em>He received Italy's highest literary award, the Premio Strega, was named a Chevalier de la L�gion d'Honneur by the French government, and is an honorary member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters.</p><h2>A Casualty of War: A Bess Crawford Mystery (Bess Crawford Mysteries, 9)</h2><p><p>From <em>New York Times</em> bestselling author Charles Todd comes a haunting tale that explores the impact of World War I on all who witnessed it&#x2014;officers, soldiers, doctors, and battlefield nurses like Bess Crawford.</p><p>Though the Great War is nearing its end, the fighting rages on.

Then the Captain is brought back to the aid station with a more severe wound, once more angrily denouncing the Lieutenant as a killer.

Please send your comments about this<br> book to us in care of zreview@zondervan.com. Thank you.<br> &#x201c;Why another book on fathering?&#x201d;<br> That was the question that immediately came to mind when we<br> decided to write this book. And it deserves an answer.<br> The short answer is this: This book will show you how to move<br> from &#x201c;fathering for performance&#x201d; to &#x201c;fathering the heart.&#x201d; But what<br> do we mean by &#x201c;fathering the heart&#x201d;? And why is it so important?<br> Even the dullest observer, taking only a cursory look at the statistics,<br> can see that the state of the family is getting worse, not better.<br> So what&#x2019;s the problem? Is it because children are tearing their<br> families apart? Sometimes, but it&#x2019;s the exception. Is it because mothers<br> are abandoning their children? Every now and then you hear a<br> sensational story like this, but only rarely. Who, then, is most<br> responsible for this crisis? Could it be that fathers are not equipped<br> to hold their families together?<br> We think it&#x2019;s about the dads.<br> Don&#x2019;t get us wrong. Most dads want to do the right thing&#x2014;<br> they just don&#x2019;t know what it is or how to go about doing it. So they<br> do the best they can to control behavior, keep peace, urge better<br> grades, keep &#x201c;Mom&#x201d; happy, and get through it. In short, they<br> &#x201c;father for performance.&#x201d; Because most of us know only the<br> &#x201c;fathering for performance&#x201d; model, untold numbers of dads (who<br> really want to do the right thing) are instead alienating yet another<br> generation of kids. They pass on the sins of their fathers, repeating<br> rather than breaking the cycle.<br> This book will show you how to build a gospel-based parenting<br> system to &#x201c;father the hearts&#x201d; of your children. So what&#x2019;s our<br> answer to the question? We do need another book on fathering, a<br> book about fathering the hearts of your children to help you break<br> the cycle of fathering for performance.<br> We have a second, more personal, reason for writing this book.<br> When a dad who grew up in a dysfunctional home breaks with the<br> past, he sets an entire family on a new course for many generations.<br> Does this sound like an overstatement?<br> Actually, we both know from experience the power of a dad who<br> breaks the cycle and fathers the heart. We know, because both of<br> our fathers broke the cycle for us, for our children, and for our children&#x2019;s<br> children.<br> Pat&#x2019;s Story<br> When my dad, Bob, was just two years old, his father abandoned<br> the family. To make ends meet, my dad&#x2019;s oldest brother,<br> Harry, went to work on a bread truck before school, at the butcher<br> shop after school, and at the filling station on weekends&#x2014;at the age<br> of ten.<br> When my dad turned six, he, too, went to work, helping out on<br> the bread truck and delivering papers. The brothers got up at 3:00<br> A.M. every day and had a permanent tardy slip for school.<br> My dad&#x2019;s mother, Mae, suffered a stroke. The family soon lost its<br> small farm and moved into town to live with two of Mae&#x2019;s sisters.<br> Together these women reared my dad and his three siblings. And<br> they did a great job! God gave these women grace, and God himself<br> became my dad&#x2019;s dad. God said he would be &#x201c;a<br> father to the fatherless&#x201d; (Psalm 68:5).<br> My dad never knew the warmth of a<br> father&#x2019;s embrace, never felt the scratch of his<br> dad&#x2019;s whiskers, never overheard his dad<br> whistling or singing while he worked, never<br> smelled his work clothes, never heard him<br> joke around or read a bedtime story, never<br> heard him say &#x201c;I love you, son&#x201d; or &#x201c;I&#x2019;m proud<br> of you, son,&#x201d; never received a father&#x2019;s approval<br> or guidance, and had to guess at what it meant<br> to be a father to me.<br> Dad&#x2019;s Legacy<br> My dad passed away last year. Dad never<br> wanted his legacy counted in money or<br> achievements. He had one mission in life: to<br> break the cycle. By his determination and sacrifice,<br> my dad was determined to give my<br> three brothers and me what he missed.<br> I have many fond memories. My dad<br> loved me. My dad invested in my life. He gave<br> me his time. He attended my games. He took me to work with him.<br> We shared chores on the five acres where we lived. My dad taught<br> me what it meant to be a man&#x2014;how to live with integrity, how to<br> practice a strong work ethic, and how to treat a woman. I am what<br> I am today because my dad refused to follow in his father&#x2019;s footsteps.<br> Like every man who misses out on having a good father, my dad<br> had to decide if he would repeat the sins of his father or break the<br> cycle. By God&#x2019;s grace, my dad chose to become a real man. My dad<br> became the man he was in spite of his father, while I am who I am<br> largely because of my father.<br> Chapter 1: Why Another Book on Fathering?<br> As I&#x2019;ve considered Dad&#x2019;s life and the odds against him, I have,<br> by God&#x2019;s grace, come to understand something important. While<br> you measure the success and legacy of some men by how far they<br> go, you grasp the secret to my dad&#x2019;s success and legacy only by seeing<br> how far he came.<br> But all was not perfect in paradise. The problem was that Dad<br> didn&#x2019;t know what a &#x201c;normal&#x201d; father looked like. He knew what he<br> didn&#x2019;t want to be like, but he had no mental image of what he did<br> want to be like. So he had to, in the words of dysfunctional family<br> systems expert Janet Woititz, &#x201c;guess at what normal behavior is.&#x201d;1<br></p><h2>Into Oblivion: An Icelandic Thriller (An Inspector Erlendur Series, 11)</h2><p><p>Loyal readers of Arnaldur Indridason's Erlendur series will be thrilled by <i>Into Oblivion, </i>the mesmerizing follow-up to the gritty prequel <i>Reykjavik Nights</i>.

In these pages you&#x2019;ll also meet Maya and Zuni, two orphaned baby hummingbirds who hatched from eggs the size of navy beans, and who are little more than air bubbles fringed with feathers. Their lives hang precariously in the balance&#x2014;but with human help, they may one day conquer the sky. <br><br>Snowball is a cockatoo whose dance video went viral on YouTube and who&#x2019;s now teaching schoolchildren how to dance. You&#x2019;ll meet Harris&#x2019;s hawks named Fire and Smoke. And you&#x2019;ll come to know and love a host of other avian characters who will change your mind forever about who birds really are. <br><br>Each of these birds shows a different and utterly surprising aspect of what makes a bird a bird&#x2014;and these are the lessons of <i>Birdology</i>: that birds are far stranger, more wondrous, and at the same time more like us than we might have dared to imagine. In <i>Birdology, </i>beloved author of <i>The Good Good Pig </i>Sy Montgomery explores the essence of the otherworldly creatures we see every day. By way of her adventures with seven birds&#x2014;wild, tame, exotic, and common&#x2014;she weaves new scientific insights and narrative to reveal seven kernels of bird wisdom. <br><br>The first lesson of <i>Birdology </i>is that, no matter how common they are, Birds Are Individuals, as each of Montgomery&#x2019;s distinctive Ladies clearly shows. In the leech-infested rain forest of Queensland, you&#x2019;ll come face to face with a cassowary&#x2014;a 150-pound, man-tall, flightless bird with a helmet of bone on its head and a slashing razor-like toenail with which it (occasionally) eviscerates people&#x2014;proof that Birds Are Dinosaurs. You&#x2019;ll learn from hawks that Birds Are Fierce; from pigeons, how Birds Find Their Way Home; from parrots, what it means that Birds Can Talk; and from 50,000 crows who moved into a small city&#x2019;s downtown, that Birds Are Everywhere. They are the winged aliens who surround us. <br><br><i><br>Birdology </i>explains just how very "other" birds are: Their hearts look like those of crocodiles. They are covered with modified scales, which are called feathers. Their bones are hollow. Their bodies are permeated with extensive air sacs. They have no hands. They give birth to eggs. Yet despite birds&#x2019; and humans&#x2019; disparate evolutionary paths, we share emotional and intellectual abilities that allow us to communicate and even form deep bonds. When we begin to comprehend who birds really are, we deepen our capacity to approach, understand, and love these otherworldly creatures. And this, ultimately, is the priceless lesson of <i>Birdology</i>: it communicates a heartfelt fascination and awe for birds and restores our connection to these complex, mysterious fellow creatures.</p><p>Sy Montgomery is a naturalist, documentary scriptwriter, and author of twenty acclaimed books of nonfiction for adults and children, including the National Book Award finalist <i>The Soul of an Octopus </i>and the memoir&nbsp;<i>The Good Good Pig</i>, a&nbsp;<i>New York Times&nbsp;</i>bestseller.

Though I have written elsewhere about those emus, I never got around to a whole book about birds, mostly because mammals kept jumping the line: chimps, gorillas, and orangutans. Man-eating tigers. Amazon River dolphins. Snow leopards. Tree kangaroos. Our wonderful pig, Christopher Hogwood. Putting off this book was not intentional, but perhaps fortunate. It is easier to understand our fellow mammals; birds are more distant and enigmatic. It has taken me all this time even to begin to learn how to probe their mysteries.<br> <br>Birds have been trying to educate me since I was a child. I have always loved watching and reading about and learning from them. But even more importantly, birds always come into my life at critical moments to enrich my spirit and enlarge my heart.<br> <br>The first male ever to court me&#x2014;I was only a child but I loved him deeply&#x2014;was a bird. I was seven. His name was Jerry. He was a green parakeet who came home with me from a dime store. And although I was delighted when he first agreed to perch on my hand and thrilled when he would finally fly to me, I was most honored when he threw up on my finger. Even though I had never seen any other creature do this in quite the same way, I understood what was happening: he was feeding me. This was a mark of deep trust and affection, and he would do this only with me. He had taken me as his mate.<br> <br>I was entranced and honored by everything Jerry did. I loved the way he used his curved beak to hull his round millet seeds. He&#x2019;d pierce the husk with his lower mandible and peel the outer husk away by forcing the seed against his ridged palate and twirling it with his strong, muscular tongue. Jerry was thrillingly different from everyone else I had known. Even his digestive system was a radical departure from those of mammals, as I could clearly see from his droppings, which appeared from a single opening and incorporated both waste products in one neat little two-colored package. And of course I loved that Jerry could fly. I let him do so often, to my mother&#x2019;s dismay. He liked to perch on the crystal chandelier over her prized mahogany dining room table, with predictable consequences.<br> <br>People used to ask me if I wanted to teach Jerry to talk. I did not. I already had friends who talked. I wanted him to teach <i>me</i> what <i>he</i> knew, for I realized that he was the master and I the student. Among the many things he showed me was that birds stir our souls in ways that change our lives.<br> <br>The ancients knew this well. Images of birds adorn the walls of the caves of Lascaux, accompanying prehistoric humans on the hunt. It&#x2019;s easy to imagine why people carved pictures of birds on tombs as early as 2600 B.C. Birds fly through the air, the element of our breath; they symbolize the soul. From Sufi poetry to native American myths, from Egyptian tombs to Christian tapestries, birds beguile us. With their beauty, their songs, their flight, and their very strangeness, birds stir our deepest psychic strivings. Even the commonest of birds (remember Jonathan Livingston Seagull?) wield the power to thrill and inspire.<br> <br>No wonder bird-watching is the fastest-growing of all outdoor activities in the United States and one of the most popular hobbies the world around. Happily, there are many hundreds of excellent books in print on bird-watching and classification. This book is not among them. Instead, these pages address a dilemma about which British author Tim Dee writes in his book <i>A Year on the Wing.</i> &#x201c;We seek the truth of birds through collection and classification,&#x201d; he writes. But the truth of birds eludes us. Of a woodcock he recorded at age thirteen, he writes, &#x201c;I was sure of our identification ... but it offered so little of itself that I felt I had been simultaneously shown the bird and excluded from it.&#x201d; He calls this &#x201c;the defining condition of bird-watching.&#x201d; We can know a bird&#x2019;s name; we can identify it and by its sighting add it to our &#x201c;life list&#x201d;; but still, the essence of the bird flies away.<br> <br>Even though birds are all around us, most of them are strangers. We don&#x2019;t know them as individuals. We know very little of what it might be like to be a bird. If we did, we would be awestruck. That is the purpose of this book: to restore both our awe and our connection to these winged aliens who live among us.<br> <br>Birds are the only wild animals most people see every day. No matter where we live, birds live with us. Too many of us take them for granted. We don&#x2019;t appreciate how very strange they are, how different. We don&#x2019;t realize what otherworldly creatures birds are.<br> <br>Their hearts look like those of crocodiles. Birds are covered with modified scales&#x2014;we call them feathers. Their bones are hollow, permeated with extensive air sacs. They have no hands. They give birth to eggs.<br> <br>No other scientific classification of living creature we commonly see is so different from us as is the class Aves. We don&#x2019;t even think of birds as &#x201c;animals&#x201d; (although they are&#x2014;as are humans, of course). We consider &#x201c;animals&#x201d; to be our fellow mammals, with whom our kinship is obvious. It&#x2019;s easy to see a kindred soul when you look into the eyes of a chimp, for instance. They share more than 98 percent of our DNA. You can get a blood transfusion from a chimp. We shared a common ancestor with chimps as recently as 5 million years ago. But actually, all mammals now living (except for the pouched marsupials like kangaroos and the egg-laying platypus and echidna) share at least 90 percent of their genetic material with humans. We shared a common ancestor with even the most distant of our fellow placental mammals as recently as 100 million years ago. The last ancestor we shared with the birds, however, traces back 325 to 350 million years ago.<br> <br>A bird is as distant from us as a dinosaur. But unlike the extinct monsters of the Jurassic and Cretaceous, birds today are everywhere among us&#x2014;on our sidewalks, at our bird feeders, on our dinner plates. Yet despite our disparate evolutionary paths, scientists are now beginning to reveal the extent to which birds&#x2019; emotional and intellectual abilities are remarkably like ours.<br> <br>To understand birds is to appreciate at once their fundamental strangeness and sameness. What makes a bird a bird? To explore this question, in these pages I share my adventures with seven different bird species. Each chapter explores a different aspect of avian essence. Here are seven essential truths about birds.<br> <br>In my opinion, the first thing you need to know about birds is that Birds Are Individuals. That&#x2019;s why I begin this book with the Ladies, my flock of emotional, intelligent, and highly individualistic hens, who come when called, love to visit the neighbors, and befriend and feud with fellow chickens. Although a flock of hens is all about community, each chicken is quite distinctive, and the personality of each individual is extremely important to the flock dynamic. People who don&#x2019;t know chickens are always astonished to learn this, but when you are in the company of birds, you must be prepared to be surprised.<br> <br>A second fundamental truth of birds is that Birds Are Dinosaurs. That may be difficult to see when you&#x2019;re watching a fluffy chickadee at the feeder, but it is abundantly clear when you are crashing through the rain forest of Queensland, Australia, pursuing a 150-pound cassowary, a bird as tall as a man, crowned with a helmet of bone on its head and a killer claw on each foot. Following these birds&#x2019; tyrannosaur-like footprints, I traveled back in time, to an era of wondrous transformation.<br> <br>The dinosaurian lineage that became the birds left the earth for the skies. And in doing this, they utterly reshaped their bodies inside and out. We mammals are made mainly of heavy fluids, but as I point out in another chapter, Birds Are Made of Air. Their bones are hollow; their feathers weigh more than the skeleton. Their bodies are full of air sacs; their feathers, also hollow shafted, are sculpted to capture and move air. Birds are essentially feather-fringed bubbles&#x2014;a fact frustratingly poignant to bird rehabilitators, whose Herculean task it is to nurse back to health, or raise to adulthood, beings whose essential fragility gives them the power to conquer the sky. It was my great luck to apprentice myself to a woman whose job was yet more difficult than that of most bird rehabilitators. Brenda Sherburn&#x2019;s specialty is raising orphaned baby hummingbirds, who hatch from eggs the size of navy beans and are born the size of bumblebees. They are air wrapped in light&#x2014;the lightest birds in the sky.<br> <br>What else must we know before we begin to understand what makes a bird a bird? Birds&#x2019; wildness, for one. Even a pet parakeet, even a barnyard chicken is wild in a way that most mammals are not. To explore this, I embarked on a study of falconry, for the hawks and falcons exhibit a genius for instinct that showcases the brilliance of all birds&#x2019; wildness.<br> <br>Birds are able to apprehend the world in ways that we cannot. They can see polarized and ultraviolet light. They experience colors we can never know. They sense the earth&#x2019;s magnetic field, navigate using subtle changes in odor and barometric pressure. They imbibe realities of this world that we cannot fathom and use them to circumnavigate the globe. We are only now starting to understand how birds accomplish these extraordinary feats, by way of one of our most ordinary and unappreciated birds, the pigeon&#x2014;the hero of yet another chapter.<br> <br>Though gifted with instincts and senses that we lack, birds&#x2019; intellectual capacities are shockingly similar to our own. Some birds appreciate human art to the extent that they can learn to tell the difference between the paintings of Monet and those of Manet. Some birds love to dance&#x2014;and in the course of researching this book, I got to dance with one of them. Birds&#x2019; capacity for song is of course so legendary that many cultures tell us the birds taught music to humans. There are birds who can even speak to us meaningfully in our own language&#x2014;something that, many scientists believe, even our close hominid cousins, the Neanderthals, probably could not do. But Birds Can Talk. In these pages, I relate some of what they tell us.<br> <br>And finally, to apprehend the truth of birds, we need to appreciate birds&#x2019; ubiquity: Birds Are Everywhere. The final chapter takes us to a winter crow roost of tens of thousands of birds, a congregation that had been traditionally based in the countryside but, like the majority of the world&#x2019;s population of humans, has moved into the city. How do the city&#x2019;s people react to their new urban neighbors? And what does this say about the future of humans and birds living together on this sweet, green earth?<br> <br>Just as I was beginning to research this book, my friend Gretchen Vogel called me with an unusual suggestion: that we should go to church together. I was raised Methodist, she was raised Catholic, but the church she had in mind was the First Universalist Church in West Chesterfield, New Hampshire, about an hour&#x2019;s drive from my house and twenty minutes from hers. She had read a notice in our local paper about that week&#x2019;s sermon. The title was &#x201c;Birdology.&#x201d; How could I resist?<br> <br>The small church, built in 1830, had no cross in the front, and the ceiling inside was painted a light blue, like the sky. Gretchen and I joined six other people in the congregation that Sunday. Presiding was a visiting pastor, Rev. Elaine Bomford.<br> <br>A smiling, articulate woman in her fifties, the pastor greeted us with the confession that &#x201c;birdology&#x201d; was a word she had made up. She invented &#x201c;birdologist&#x201d; to describe the person who&#x2014;unlike the ornithologist, with his fancy university degree&#x2014;hasn&#x2019;t completed a formal course of avian study. To be a birdologist, she said, &#x201c;you just have to appreciate birds and be intentional about appreciating birds in some way.&#x201d; We could all be birdologists, she said&#x2014;and we should be. For watching birds, she told us, &#x201c;strengthens our souls.&#x201d;<br> <br>A birdologist, she explained, &#x201c;experiences the divinity of creation revealed in the birds.&#x201d;<br> <br>That pretty much describes what I have always felt when I see a bird&#x2014;any bird. The ancients believed that birds could bring us messages from the gods: whether a battle would be won or lost, or if plenty or famine would befall the city. Birds do bring us messages from the divine, but not necessarily those the ancients sought. Because of birds&#x2019; very different lineage; because they are made of different stuff than we; because of the powers that birds possess that we do not; and because, despite our deep differences, we can share much of a bird&#x2019;s mental and emotional experience, birds bring us news far more important than our own personal, human lives. They bring us news about the larger and more wondrous <i>life,</i> about a world that we, with our merely human senses, have barely begun to perceive.<br> <br>Birds teach us reverence&#x2014;a virtue that, writes classicist and philosopher Paul Woodruff, &#x201c;begins in a deep understanding of human limitations.&#x201d; No beings show us our limitations better than do the birds. When we see a bird in flight or let our hearts soar on the notes of its song, the mystery of the world wells up before us&#x2014;a mystery we long to embrace rather than conquer.<br> <br>That day in the church, Rev. Bomford asked us to speak words with her from Terry Tempest Williams&#x2019;s book <i>Refuge</i>.<br> <br>&#x201c;I pray to the birds,&#x201d; we read, &#x201c;because I believe they will carry the messages of my heart upward ...&#x201d;<br> <br>Oh, yes, I thought. It was then the time of the fall migration, and with every overhead &#x201c;V&#x201d; I utter a prayer for the birds&#x2019; safe passage.<br> <br>&#x201c;I pray to the birds,&#x201d; we continued, &#x201c;because they remind me of what I love rather than what I fear ...&#x201d;<br> <br>I thought back to my time with the emus. At first sight, I had fallen wildly, passionately, soul splittingly in love. I had been working alone, collecting plant samples on a wombat preserve in the outback, when I looked up and saw them: three birds standing tall as a man, approaching me on their long, balletic, backward-bending legs&#x2014;legs so strong they were capable of ending my life with a single kick. Instantly, I was smitten by both their strangeness and familiarity. There was no room for fear. My heart was filled with awe.<br> <br>Reading Terry Tempest Williams&#x2019;s words, I gave thanks for all the many birds I have loved in my life: my parakeet Jerry; a cockatiel named Kokopelli who liked to sit on my head and whistle the National Geographic theme song when I was on the phone; my beloved Ladies. I did not know then, of course, that this book would bring me many more individual birds to love: the dancing cockatoo Snowball; Harris&#x2019;s hawks named Jazz and Fire and Smoke; a talking African grey parrot named Griffin; two orphaned baby hummingbirds who, God willing, could be raising babies of their own somewhere in California as I write these words right now.<br> <br>&#x201c; ... And at the end of my prayers,&#x201d; the few of us gathered in the church that morning read, birds &#x201c;teach me how to listen.&#x201d;<br> <br>This was my prayer as I began working on this book. It&#x2019;s my hope that the birds you will meet in these pages will teach you, too.<br> <br>&#x2014;Sy Montgomery<br>May 19, 2009<br>Hancock, N.H.<br> <br>� 2010 Sy Montgomery</p><h2>Heat and Light: A Novel</h2><p><p><strong>A BEST BOOK OF THE YEAR: <em>New York Times, The Washington Post, The Wall Street Journal</em>, NPR</strong></p><p>Acclaimed <em>New York Times</em> bestselling author Jennifer Haigh returns to the Pennsylvania town at the center of her iconic novel <em>Baker Towers</em> in this ambitious, achingly human story of modern America and the conflicting forces at its heart&#x2014;a bold, moving drama of hope and desperation, greed and power, big business and small-town families.</p><p>Forty years ago, Bakerton coal fueled the country.

What other new kid comes to school wearing pajamas and cowboy boots one day and a polka-dot t-shirt and tutu on another? Gooney Bird has to sit right smack in the middle of the class because she likes to be in the middle of everything. She is the star of story time and keeps her teacher and classmates on the edge of their seats with her &#x201c;absolutely true&#x201d; stories. But what about her classmates? Do they have stories good enough to share?</p><p><p>Lois Lowry is known for her versatility and invention as a writer. She was born in Hawaii and grew up in New York, Pennsylvania, and Japan. After several years at Brown University, she turned to her family and to writing. She is the author of more than thirty books for young adults, including the popular Anastasia Krupnik series. She has received countless honors, among them the Boston Globe-Horn Book Award, the Dorothy Canfield Fisher Award, the California Young Reader's Medal, and the Mark Twain Award. She received Newbery Medals for two of her novels, "Number the Stars "and" The Giver." Her first novel, "A Summer to Die," was awarded the International Reading Association's Children's Book Award. Ms. Lowry now divides her time between Cambridge and an 1840s farmhouse in Maine.

She arrived in October, after the first month of school had already passed. She opened the second grade classroom door at ten o'clock on a Wednesday morning and appeared there all alone, without even a mother to introduce her. She was wearing pajamas and cowboy boots and was holding a dictionary and a lunch box.<br><br>"Hello," Mrs. Pidgeon, the second grade teacher, said. "We're in the middle of our spelling lesson."<br><br>"Good," said the girl in pajamas. "I brought my dictionary. Where's my desk?"<br><br>"Who are you?" Mrs. Pidgeon asked politely.<br><br>"I'm your new student. My name is Gooney Bird Greene -- that's Greene with a silent 'e' at the end -- and I just moved here from China. I want a desk right smack in the middle of the room, because I like to be right smack in the middle of everything."<br><br>The class stared at the new girl with admiration. They had never met anyone like Gooney Bird Greene.<br><br>She was a good student. She sat down at the desk Mrs. Pidgeon provided, right smack in the middle of everything, and began doing second grade spelling. She did all her work neatly and quickly, and she followed instructions.<br><br>But soon it was clear that Gooney Bird was mysterious and interesting. Her clothes were unusual. Her hairstyles were unusual. Even her lunches were very unusual.<br><br>At lunchtime on Wednesday, her first day in the school, she opened her lunch box and brought out sushi and a pair of bright green chopsticks. On Thursday, her second day at Watertower Elementary School, Gooney Bird Greene was wearing a pink ballet tutu over green stretch pants, and she had three small red grapes, an avocado, and an oatmeal cookie for lunch.<br><br>On Thursday afternoon, after lunch, Mrs. Pidgeon stood in front of the class with a piece of chalk in her hand. "Today," she said, "we are going to continue talking about stories."<br><br>"Yay!" the second-graders said in very loud voices, all but Felicia Ann, who never spoke, and Malcolm, who wasn't paying attention. He was under his desk, as usual.<br><br>"Gooney Bird, you weren't here for the first month of school. But our class has been learning about what makes good stories, haven't we?" Mrs. Pidgeon said. Everyone nodded. All but Malcolm, who was under his desk doing something with scissors.<br><br>"Class? What does a story need most of all? Who remembers?" Mrs. Pidgeon had her chalk hand in the air, ready to write something on the board.<br><br>The children were silent for a minute. They were thinking. Finally Chelsea raised her hand.<br><br>"Chelsea? What does a story need?"<br><br>"A book," Chelsea said.<br><br>Mrs. Pidgeon put her chalk hand down. "There are many stories that don't need a book," she said pleasantly, "aren't there, class? If your grandma tells you a story about when she was a little girl, she doesn't have that story in a book, does she?"<br><br>The class stared at her. All but Malcolm, who was still under his desk, and Felicia Ann, who always looked at the floor, never raised her hand, and never spoke.<br><br>Beanie said, "My grandma lives in Boston!"<br><br>Keiko said, "My grandma lives in Honolulu!"<br><br>Ben said loudly, "My grandma lives in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania!"<br><br>Tricia shouted, "My grandma is very rich!"<br><br>"Class!" said Mrs. Pidgeon. "Shhh!" Then, in a quieter voice, she explained, "Another time, we will talk about our families. But right now --" She stopped talking and looked at Barry Tuckerman. Barry was up on his knees in his seat, and his hand was waving in the air as hard as he could make it wave.<br><br>"Barry?" Mrs. Pidgeon said. "Do you have something that you simply have to say? Something that cannot possibly wait?"<br><br>Barry nodded yes. His hand waved.<br><br>"And what is so important?"<br><br>Barry stood up beside his desk. Barry Tuckerman liked to make very important speeches, and they always required that he stand.<br><br>"My grandma," Barry Tuckerman said, "went to jail once. She was twenty years old and she went to jail for civil disobedience." Then Barry sat down.<br><br>"Thank you, Barry. Now look at what I'm writing on the board. Who can read this word?"<br><br>Everyone, all but Malcolm and Felicia Ann, watched as she wrote the long word. Then they shouted it out. "BEGINNING!"<br><br>"Good!" said Mrs. Pidgeon. "Now I'm sure you'll all know this one." She wrote again.<br><br>"MIDDLE!" the children shouted.<br><br>"Good. And can you guess what the last word will be?" She held up her chalk and waited.<br><br>"END!"<br><br>"Correct!" Mrs. Pidgeon said. "Good for you, second-graders! Those are the parts that a story needs: a beginning, a middle, and an end. Now I'm going to write another very long word on the board. Let's see what good readers you are." She wrote a C, then an H.<br><br>"Mrs. Pidgeon!" someone called.<br><br>She wrote an A, and then an R.<br><br>"MRS. PIDGEON!" Several children were calling now.<br><br>She turned to see what was so important. Malcolm was standing beside his desk. He was crying.<br><br>"Malcolm needs to go to the nurse, Mrs. Pidgeon!" Beanie said.<br><br>Mrs. Pidgeon went to Malcolm and knelt beside him. "What's the trouble, Malcolm?" she asked. But he couldn't stop crying.<br><br>"I know, I know!" Nicholas said. Nicholas always knew everything, and his desk was beside Malcolm's.<br><br>"Tell me, Nicholas."<br><br>"Remember Keiko showed us how to make origami stars?"<br><br>All of the second-graders reached into their desks and their pockets and their lunch boxes. There were tiny stars everywhere. Keiko had shown them how to make origami stars out of small strips of paper. The stars were very easy to make. The school janitor had complained just last Friday that he was sweeping up hundreds of origami stars.<br><br>"Malcolm put one in his nose," Nicholas said, "and now he can't get it out."<br><br>"Is that correct, Malcolm?" Mrs. Pidgeon asked. Malcolm nodded and wiped his eyes.<br><br>"Don't sniff, Malcolm. Do not sniff. That is an order." She took his hand and walked with him to the classroom door. She turned to the class. "Children," she said, "I am going to be gone for exactly one minute and thirty seconds while<br><br>I walk with Malcolm to the nurse's office down the hall.<br><br>Stay in your seats while I'm gone. Think about the word character.<br><br>"A character is what a story needs. When I come back from the nurse's office, we are going to create a story together. You must choose who the main character will be. Talk among yourselves quietly. Think about interesting characters like Abraham Lincoln, or perhaps Christopher Columbus, or --"<br><br>"Babe Ruth?" called Ben.<br><br>"Yes, Babe Ruth is a possibility. I'll be right back."<br><br>Mrs. Pidgeon left the classroom with Malcolm.<br><br>When she returned, one minute and thirty seconds later, without Malcolm, the class was waiting. They had been whispering, all but Felicia Ann, who never whispered.<br><br>"Have you chosen?" she asked. The class nodded. All of their heads went up and down, except Felicia Ann's, because she always looked at the �oor.<br><br>"And your choice is --?"<br><br>All of the children, all but Felicia Ann, called out together. "Gooney Bird Greene!" they called.<br><br>Mrs. Pidgeon sighed. "Class," she said, "there are many different kinds of stories. There are stories about imaginary creatures, like --"<br><br>"Dumbo!" Tricia called out.<br><br>"Raise your hand if you want to speak, please," Mrs. Pidgeon said. "But yes, Tricia, you are correct. Dumbo is an imaginary character. There are also stories about real people from history, like Christopher Columbus, and --" She stopped. Barry Tuckerman was waving and waving his hand. "Yes, Barry? Do you have something very important to say?"<br><br>Barry Tuckerman stood up. He twisted the bottom of his shirt around and around in his fingers. "I forget," he said at last.<br><br>"Well, sit back down then, Barry. Now, I thought, class, that since Christopher Columbus's birthday is coming up soon --" She looked at Barry Tuckerman, whose hand was waving like a windmill once again. "Barry?" she said.<br><br>Barry Tuckerman stood up again. "We already know all the stories about Christopher Columbus," he said. "We want to hear a true story about Gooney Bird Greene."<br><br>"Yes! Gooney Bird Greene!" the class called.<br><br>Mrs. Pidgeon sighed again. "I'm afraid I don't know many facts abut Gooney Bird Greene," she said. "I know a lot of facts about Christopher Columbus, though. Christopher Columbus was born in --"<br><br>"We want Gooney Bird!" the class chanted.<br><br>"Gooney Bird?" Mrs. Pidgeon said, finally. "How do you feel about this?"<br><br>Gooney Bird Greene stood up beside her desk in the middle of the room. "Can I tell the story?" she asked. "Can I be right smack in the middle of everything? Can I be the hero?"<br><br>"Well, since you would be the main character," Mrs. Pidgeon said, "I guess that would put you in the middle of everything. I guess that would make you the hero."<br><br>"Good," Gooney Bird said. "I will tell you an absolutely true story about me."</p><h2>1,000 Artist Trading Cards: Innovative and Inspired Mixed Media ATCs</h2><p><b>ATCs are all the rage!</b><p>Making artist trading cards (ATCs) is a hugely popular activity for artists. Originally a paper/collage-based art form, ATCs have caught on with crafters working in a range of mediums and are now just as popular among fabric and mixed-media artists. ATCs are mini art works, the size of a playing card, often created as limited editions. The back of each card contains the artist's name and contact information. The idea behind the cards is to make them and then give, trade, or share them with others. This collection inspires with 1,000 original cards in a beautiful pageant of color, composition, and creative use of materials. The book also includes a special section devoted to explaining what ATCs are, how to get started, and includes some exciting technique information.

But for the narrator of <i>When the Plums Are Ripe</i>, the poet Pouka, the season reminds him of the &#x201c;time when our country had discovered the root not so much of its own violence as that of the world&#x2019;s own, and, in response, had thrown its sons who at that time were called Senegalese infantrymen into the desert, just as in the evenings the sellers throw all their still-unsold plums into the embers.&#x201d; In this novel of radiant lyricism, Patrice Nganang recounts the story of Cameroon&#x2019;s forced entry into World War II, and in the process complicates our own understanding of that globe-spanning conflict. After the fall of France in 1940, Cameroon found itself caught between Vichy and the Free French at a time when growing nationalism advised allegiance to neither regime, and was ultimately dragged into fighting throughout North Africa on behalf of the Allies.</p><p>Moving from Pouka&#x2019;s story to the campaigns of the French general Leclerc and the battles of Kufra and Murzuk, Nganang questions the colonial record and recenters African perspectives at the heart of Cameroon&#x2019;s national history, all the while writing with wit and panache. <i>When the Plums Are Ripe</i> is a brilliantly crafted, politically charged epic that challenges not only the legacies of colonialism but the intersections of language, authority, and history itself.</p></p><p><p><b>Patrice Nganang</b> was born in Cameroon and is a novelist, poet, and essayist. His novel <i>Temps de chien </i>received the Prix Marguerite Yourcenar and the Grand prix litt�raire d&#x2019;Afrique noire. He is also the author of <i>La Joie de vivre</i> and <i>L&#x2019;Invention d&#x2019;un beau regard</i>. He teaches comparative literature at Stony Brook University.</p><p><b>Amy Baram Reid </b>is a professor of French language and literature at New College of Florida.

The plot and action are matched by the author&#x2019;s powerful take on the damage colonialism inflicts for generations.&#x201d; &#x2015;<b>Bethanne Patrick, <i>The Washington Post</i></b></p><p>&#x201c;What happens to a colony when its colonizer becomes colonized itself?

Clean. So why did things go so wrong for the determined young bride?</p><p>I flew to the Caribbean on a Wednesday, and Thursday morning gave the blackmailer&#x2019;s bagman a routing number to an account containing $109,000. The bagman gave me a video shot secretly at a party thrown by my goddaughter, Shay Money, for her bridesmaids.</p><p>In the sepulchre chill of a cubicle provided by the Bank of Aruba, I popped the cassette into a minicamera long enough to confirm its contents before nodding at the teller.</p><p>Yes. She could transfer the funds.</p><p>Bagman and teller conversed in patois French as I stowed the cassette in a briefcase, focusing on details to mitigate my nausea. Inside the men&#x2019;s room, I filled a marble sink with water, then lathered face and hands, but the taint was subcutaneous, associative. Soap couldn&#x2019;t cut it. I had helped Shay with high school homework. I&#x2019;d fielded her homesick letters when she was a college freshman.</p><p>After leaving the bank, I pulled my rental around the block, waited, then followed the bagman&#x2019;s Fiat to a waterfront bar. Big round man, big round head. I battled the urge to snatch him from the parking lot, then drive to a secluded place.</p><p>I&#x2019;m no longer authorized to do that sort of thing.</p><p>Eight hours later, I landed at Miami International, then caught a commuter flight to Fort Myers Regional, a forty-minute drive from my home and laboratory on Sanibel Island, southwest coast of Florida. Shay, now twenty-six, with a master&#x2019;s in business, was waiting.</p><p>&#x201c;Did you check luggage?&#x201d;</p><p>I was carrying the briefcase and a recent issue of <i>Journal of Invertebrate Pathology.</i></p><p>&#x201c;Never.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Ah . . . I forgot. All those research trips, studying fish in foreign countries. What&#x2019;s the secret to packing light?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Simple. Wear dark clothes, and always save your second pair of socks for the flight home.&#x201d;</p><p>The girl laughed as we hugged. &#x201c;Doc Ford, the mysterious biologist. I picked the right guy.&#x201d;</p><p>I said, &#x201c;It&#x2019;s been awhile. We&#x2019;ll see.&#x201d;</p><p>Shay had her arm around my waist, shoulder wedged into ribs, thumb hooked to my belt. She was her usual affectionate, alpha-female self, body docked to mine so she could steer me efficiently toward baggage, or her awaiting car. But there was an intensity to the way she hugged close. This was a frightened women desperate for asylum. Had I provided it?</p><p>Life may be a chemical-electrical process, but living is a procession of uncertainties, one damn thing after another. Somehow, that truth makes lying easier.</p><p>&#x201c;Did everything . . . go okay?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Couldn&#x2019;t have gone smoother.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You feel good about it?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Better than expected. Very businesslike. We&#x2019;ve been dealing with pros.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The money transferred from my account fast enough. I checked. Geezus, one hell of a chunk. Were you . . . surprised by the amount?&#x201d;</p><p>Not surprised, shocked. But I replied, &#x201c;A lot of money.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;My entire savings.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ve saved that much since college?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Well . . . plus Daddy&#x2019;s life insurance.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Insurance? He didn&#x2019;t seem like the type.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I know, I know&#x2014;a man like him being thoughtful was as unexpected as him dying. I thought I told you about the check. After the honeymoon, Michael and I could&#x2019;ve&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s done. You said you weren&#x2019;t going to beat yourself up when I got back. I&#x2019;m back.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re right. You know the way I ought to see it? Like it&#x2019;s an investment in the future. I have to keep reminding myself. Our future, Michael and me.&#x201d;</p><p>We exited the terminal into the sodium glare of asphalt and Everglades heat. It was a Thursday in June, a little before midnight, less than ten days until the girl&#x2019;s wedding. There were stars up there above palm trees.</p><p>&#x201c;So he gave you the . . . thing.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes.&#x201d; The briefcase was on my opposite shoulder, and I tapped it. &#x201c;In here.&#x201d;</p><p>I felt her body stiffen. &#x201c;The only copy?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know. That&#x2019;s the deal you made. But it&#x2019;s his game, his rules.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Do you know why . . . why I paid the money?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I have a pretty good idea.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;So you watched.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Just the beginning. You and your bridesmaids were on a patio by a swimming pool, a view of the ocean below. With three men I assume were locals&#x2014;so the party was just getting started. That was enough.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Really?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Really.&#x201d;</p><p>Another lie. The video had been queued to footage that was unambiguously graphic. I&#x2019;d watched for a few seconds, skipped ahead, then couldn&#x2019;t hit the power button fast enough.</p><p>Yes, we had been dealing with a pro, but there were also symptoms of pathology. Voyeurism plus cruelty. Her blackmailer enjoyed humiliating his victims.</p><p>Shay laughed to disguise relief. &#x201c;Thanks for being a gentleman. Not that there&#x2019;s anything really <i>bad</i>. Just stupid. The sort of things we did in college&#x2014;smoke grass, smooch with strangers. But Michael wouldn&#x2019;t have understood. None of our guys would, even though it seemed harmless at the time. We tried to turn the clock back&#x2014;Liz, Corey, Beryl, and me&#x2014;and have one last fling . . . only now, I wish we&#x2019;d never heard of that damn island. By October, we&#x2019;ll all be married. And we&#x2019;ve got professions. We&#x2019;re grown-ups now, not sorority girls.&#x201d;</p><p>I&#x2019;d just lied to Shay, so why did I find it so irritating that she was lying to me? My own moral code varies with time zones and border crossings, plus I do not accept the premise that human behavior can be separated neatly into columns of right and wrong. So who the hell am I to judge? But I am neither so jaundiced nor na�ve that I don&#x2019;t know the difference between a kiss and a blow job.</p><p>&#x201c;Aren&#x2019;t grown-ups also supposed to accept responsibility for their behavior?&#x201d; I said.</p><p>The woman stopped walking for a moment, her expression indignant, then sped ahead. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t care for your tone, buddy boy.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Then stop treating me like I&#x2019;m stupid.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I have no idea what you&#x2019;re talking about!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Really? You didn&#x2019;t pay a hundred thousand dollars to spare your future husband seeing you smoke dope and kiss a stranger.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I just told you: Michael&#x2019;s the jealous type. Like most guys, there&#x2019;s a double standard. It doesn&#x2019;t matter if it was innocent fun. He wouldn&#x2019;t have understood.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I flew halfway to the equator and back because of innocent fun? Knock it off, Shay. I know better.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Damn it! You said you didn&#x2019;t watch the video!&#x201d;</p><p>The woman slowed enough for me to catch up, eyes searching. The footage I&#x2019;d seen was disturbing. What I had not seen was there in her eyes, and it sickened her.</p><p>I said, &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t give a damn what&#x2019;s on this tape. Whatever perceived sins, your girls&#x2019; weekend couldn&#x2019;t have been any worse than a lot of bachelor parties. Okay? And it sure as hell doesn&#x2019;t compare to some of the things I&#x2019;ve done in my life.&#x201d; I cut her off before she interrupted. &#x201c;<i>Don&#x2019;t</i> ask. We&#x2019;re all entitled to our secrets. The point is, I&#x2019;m your friend. As of today, I&#x2019;m also your partner. So no more evasions.</p><p>&#x201c;When you asked me to fly south and make the exchange, I did&#x2014;no questions asked. Now I expect the truth. Because there&#x2019;s a chance we&#x2019;re going to hear from him again.&#x201d;</p><p>Shay stopped and faced me. She took a shuddering breath, and in a voice I hadn&#x2019;t heard since she was a teen, she whispered, &#x201c;Oh . . . Ford, I hope . . . I so hope you&#x2019;re wrong.&#x201d;</p><p>I swept the girl into my free arm and held her, thumping my hand on her back. &#x201c;Me, too, Shay. But if it happens, no surprises, okay? Because it&#x2019;s started.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What? <i>What&#x2019;s</i> started? I don&#x2019;t understand.&#x201d;</p><p>I meant the lie we&#x2019;d created. It now had a life of its own. Unlike the truth, lies can&#x2019;t survive independently. They&#x2019;re quasi matter, like something sewn together in a lab, and require monitoring.</p><p>&#x201c;If we&#x2019;re not straight with each other,&#x201d; I told her, &#x201c;our friendship will be the first casualty. Your marriage could be the second.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;My God, Doc,&#x201d; the girl said, pushing away, &#x201c;don&#x2019;t even say that. Damn it! I did what I was supposed to do. I paid the money. I&#x2019;m safe now, aren&#x2019;t I? We deserve to be safe!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;This has nothing to do with wha...</p></p><h2>The Silmarillion [Illustrated]</h2><p>The first publication of a deluxe edition of The Silmarillion, featuring the revised, reset text, bound in cloth and leather and set in a clothbound slipcase. The Silmarillion is an account of the Elder Days, of the First Age of Tolkien&#39;s world. It is the ancient drama to which the characters in The Lord of the Rings look back, and in whose events some of them such as Elrond and Galadriel took part. The tales of The Silmarillion are set in an age when Morgoth, the first Dark Lord, dwelt in Middle-Earth, and the High Elves made war upon him for the recovery of the Silmarils, the jewels containing the pure light of Valinor. Included in the book are several shorter works. The Ainulindale is a myth of the Creation and in the Valaquenta the nature and powers of each of the gods is described. The Akallabeth recounts the downfall of the great island kingdom of Numenor at the end of the Second Age and Of the Rings of Power tells of the great events at the end of the Third Age, as narrated in The Lord of the Rings. For the first time, we are publishing a deluxe edition of this pivotal work, featuring the revised, corrected text and including, by way of an introduction, a fascinating letter written by Tolkien in 1951 in which he gives a full explanation of how he conceived the early Ages of Middle-earth. Bound in cloth and leather, and set in a cloth-bound slipcase, this attractive edition will prove a fine addition to any Tolkien collection.</p><p><i>The Silmarillion</i> is J.R.R. Tolkien's tragic, operatic history of the First Age of Middle-Earth, essential background material for serious readers of the classic Lord of the Rings saga. Tolkien's work sets the standard for fantasy, and this audio version of the "Bible of Middle-Earth" does <i>The Silmarillion</i> justice. Martin Shaw's reading is grave and resonant, conveying all the powerful events and emotions that shaped elven and human history long before Bilbo, Frodo, Gandalf and all the rest embarked on their quests. Beginning with the Music of the Ainur, <i>The Silmarillion</i> tells a tale of the Elder Days, when Elves and Men became estranged by the Dark Lord Morgoth's lust for the Silmarils, pure and powerful magic jewels. Even the love between a human warrior and the daughter of the Elven king cannot defeat Morgoth, but the War of Wrath finally brings down the Dark Lord. Peace reigns until the evil Sauron recovers the Rings of Power and sets the stage for the events told in the Lord of the Rings. This is epic fantasy at its finest, thrillingly read and gloriously unabridged. (Running time: 14 hours, 6 CDs)<p>Tolkien's epic legendary precursor to'THE LORD OF THE RINGS' </p><p>The Silmarilli were three perfect jewels, fashioned by Feanor, most gifted of the Elves.

Polemic? Apologia? As autobiographer, the Russian TV commentator is disappointingly reticent. Albeit revealing of his privileged early years in Paris and Manhattan with his Russian father, a Marxist, and French mother, the family's move to East Berlin in 1948 when he was 15 and their emigration to Moscow in 1953, Pozner insufficiently discloses his later life in the nomenklatura. Often the polemicist intercepts the diarist to castigate Americans for disregarding their principles of equality, but one can't take seriously Pozner's lectures on racism when he presents himself as a model of rectitude and offers as evidence his "love" for the black maid of his childhood. He is opinionated about the Soviet leadership back to Stalin, yet, perhaps wisely, checks his gait when traversing today's boggy ground, although he strongly supports glasnost. The book does not read as if Pozner were seeking an imprimatur from the General Secretary, however; his sincerity and humanism are convincing--but Pozner shows himself to be less knowing about Americans than he thinks. Author tour. <br>Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc.Pozner, a Soviet TV commentator perhaps best known for cohosting (with Phil Donahue) a televised U.S./Soviet "public meeting," is what the American Right fears most--a charming, erudite member of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union who speaks with a strong American accent. In this book, Pozner explains how he came to be who he is, taking the reader from his birth in German-occupied Paris to his formative years in New York City in the 1950s at the beginning of the Red Scare, to his arrival in the Soviet Union during the final years of Stalin. Interspersed throughout are remarks on the American and Soviet political systems. He has praise and criticism for each, though his heart belongs to Moscow.

Now Reynolds's&nbsp;meticulously researched and captivating narrative "looks among the shadows and finds a Hemingway not seen before" (<em>London Review of Books</em>), revealing for the first time the whole story of this hidden side of Hemingway's life: his troubling recruitment by Soviet spies to work with the NKVD, the forerunner to the KGB, followed in short order by a complex set of secret relationships with American agencies.</p><p>Starting with Hemingway's sympathy to antifascist forces during the 1930s, Reynolds illuminates Hemingway's immersion in the life-and-death world of the revolutionary left, from his passionate commitment to the Spanish Republic; his successful pursuit by Soviet NKVD agents, who valued Hemingway's influence, access, and mobility; his wartime meeting in East Asia with communist leader Chou En-Lai, the future premier of the People's Republic of China; and finally to his undercover involvement with Cuban rebels in the late 1950s and his sympathy for Fidel Castro. Reynolds equally explores Hemingway's participation in various roles as an agent for the United States government, including hunting Nazi submarines with ONI-supplied munitions in the Caribbean on his boat, <em>Pilar</em>; his command of an informant ring in Cuba called the "Crook Factory" that reported to the American embassy in Havana; and his on-the-ground role in Europe, where he helped OSS gain key tactical intelligence for the liberation of Paris and fought alongside the U.S. infantry in the bloody endgame of World War II.</p><p>As he examines the links between Hemingway's work as an operative and as an author, Reynolds reveals how Hemingway's secret adventures influenced his literary output and contributed to the writer's block and mental decline (including paranoia) that plagued him during the postwar years -- a period marked by the Red Scare and McCarthy hearings. Reynolds also illuminates how those same experiences played a role in some of Hemingway's greatest works, including <em>For Whom the Bell Tolls</em> and <em>The Old Man and the Sea</em>, while also adding to the burden that he carried at the end of his life and perhaps contributing to his suicide.</p><p>A literary biography with the soul of an espionage thriller, <em>Writer, Sailor, Soldier, Spy</em> is an essential contribution to our understanding of the life, work, and fate of one of America's most legendary authors.</p></p><p><p><strong>An international cloak-and-dagger epic ranging from the Spanish Civil War to the liberation of Western Europe, wartime China, the Red Scare of Cold War America, and the Cuban Revolution, HERE is the stunning untold story of a literary icon&#x2019;s dangerous secret life&#x2014;including his role as a Soviet agent code-named &#x201c;Argo&#x201d;&#x2014;that fueled his art and his undoing</strong></p><p>In 2010, while he was the historian at the esteemed CIA Museum, Nicholas Reynolds, a longtime American intelligence officer, former U.S. Marine colonel, and Oxford-trained historian, began to uncover clues suggesting Ernest Hemingway&#x2019;s involvement in mid&#x2014;twentieth-century spycraft was far more complex, sustained, and fraught with risks than has been previously understood. <em>Writer, Sailor, Soldier, Spy</em> reveals Reynolds&#x2019;s discoveries for the first time, bringing to light the whole story of this hidden side of Hemingway&#x2019;s life: his troubling recruitment by Soviet spies to work with the NKVD, the forerunner to the KGB, followed by a complex set of secret relationships with American agencies, including the FBI, the Department of State, the Office of Naval Intelligence (ONI), and the Office of Strategic Services (OSS), a precursor to the CIA.</p>A literary biography with the soul of an espionage thriller, <em>Writer, Sailor, Soldier, Spy</em> is an essential contribution to&nbsp;our understanding of the life, work, and fate of one of America&#x2019;s most legendary authors.<strong>Nicholas Reynolds</strong> has worked in the fields of modern military history and intelligence off and on for forty years, with some unusual detours.

In &#34;A Jane Austen Education,&#34; Austen scholar William Deresiewicz turns to the author&#39;s novels to reveal the remarkable life lessons hidden within. With humor and candor, Deresiewicz employs his own experiences to demonstrate the enduring power of Austen&#39;s teachings. Progressing from his days as an immature student to a happily married man, Deresiewicz&#39;s &#34;A Jane Austen Education&#34; is the story of one man&#39;s discovery of the world outside himself. A self-styled intellectual rebel dedicated to writers such as James Joyce and Joseph Conrad, Deresiewicz never thought Austen&#39;s novels would have anything to offer him. But when he was assigned to read &#34;Emma&#34; as a graduate student at Columbia, something extraordinary happened. Austen&#39;s devotion to the everyday, and her belief in the value of ordinary lives, ignited something in Deresiewicz. He began viewing the world through Austen&#39;s eyes and treating those around him as generously as Austen treated her characters. Along the way, Deresiewicz was amazed to discover that the people in his life developed the depth and richness of literary characters-that his own life had suddenly acquired all the fascination of a novel. His real education had finally begun. Weaving his own story-and Austen&#39;s-around the ones her novels tell, Deresiewicz shows how her books are both about education and themselves an education. Her heroines learn about friendship and feeling, staying young and being good, and, of course, love. As they grow up, they learn lessons that are imparted to Austen&#39;s reader, who learns and grows by their sides. &#34;A Jane Austen Education&#34; is a testament to the transformative power of literature, a celebration of Austen&#39;s mastery, and a joy to read. Whether for a newcomer to Austen or a lifelong devotee, Deresiewicz brings fresh insights to the novelist and her beloved works. Ultimately, Austen&#39;s world becomes indelibly entwined with our own, showing the relevance of her message and the triumph of her vision.</p><p>WILLIAM&nbsp;DERESIEWICZ is a widely published book critic and the author of <i>Jane Austen and the Romantic Poets</i>.

When in 1967 two members of the society went ahead with constructing two locomotives to the Torquay Manor design in 5 in gauge by LBSC (the Great Western Railways 78XXs, the 7800 class), he was asked to make the boilers for them and realised that here was the perfect opportunity to compile a photographic record of building the boilers for these locomotives; and that is what this book is - the published photographic record of that process. The two boilers pictured in the book are Garsington Manor and Granville Manor; and the author worked the whole process so that as they progressed, photographs were taken. If any proofs were unsatisfactory, then he&#39;d take new shots on the second boiler. When it was confirmed that the 2nd set of shots was up to scratch, then the work on the second boiler would be brought up to the stage of the first boiler. So what can the reader expect to get from this book? In well-illustrated, step-by-step instructions, the author explains the process of constructing a model coal-fired locomotive boiler, from the selection of tools and materials through the working of the metal, to the testing of the finished job. As well as being a satisfying project in itself, boilermaking also provides plenty of opportunities for improving general model engineering skills. Alec Farmer draws on his many years of practical experience to create an invaluable guide to this absorbing craft, highlighting the pleasures yet at the same time warning where the problems may arise and advising how they can be avoided. Readers should note that this book will help build model boilers, but it&#39;s not an instruction manual to build multiple types of boiler. The type of boiler this builds is shown on pages 12-13</p><p></p><h2>A Boy Called Slow</h2><p>Longing for a more powerful name than Slow--which he is called because he is slow in everything--a young Sioux proves his courage during a battle with enemy Crow and is given a new name, Sitting Bull, in honor of his bravery.</p><p>Joseph Bruchac is a highly acclaimed children&#39;s book author, poet, novelist and storyteller, as well as a scholar of Native American culture.

For more information about Joseph, please visit his website www.josephbruchac.com.Grade 1-6?This picture-book biography recounts the boyhood of a real Lakota Sioux named Slow, who grew up in the 1830s. Today's children of any background can empathize with his efforts to outgrow his childhood name and take his place as an adult among his people. The illustrations, oils that are rich and somber, convey details of traditional Lakota life, from the warm, close interiors of the family home to a pre-dawn assembly of warriors about to raid their Crow neighbors. The text creates an equally subtle portrayal of Plains Indian life. Many stereotypes of Native American culture are gently corrected, as when the author acknowledges that "women are the heart of the nation." The traditional Lakota explanation for the advent of horses is given alongside mention of their historical introduction by European explorers. Dialogue in the Native language helps to convey the richness of the culture. By the time Slow earns his new name, young readers will feel they know a real person?the man who was to become Sitting Bull, one of the great Sioux warriors and a hero at the Battle of Little Bighorn. This book works beautifully as historical fiction; it is less successful as biography as none of the dialogue is documented.

Among those with whom he studied were Tagore, Mahatma Gandhi, Sri Aurobindo, and Ramana Maharshi. In this collection of stories, Swami Rama relates his experiences with the great teachers who guided his life.</p><p>Sri Swami Rama, the founder of the Himalayan International Institute of Yoga Science and Philosophy, was raised in the Himalayan cave monasteries and ordained a monk in early childhood. He studied Western psychology, philosophy, and medicine in Europe and taught in Japan before coming to the United States in 1969. Here he founded the Himalayan Institute to create a bridge between the ancient teachings of the East and the modern scientific approaches of the West.The late Sri Swami Rama recalls his own spiritual journey in this memoir. Using specific incidents to illustrate spiritual truths, he presents a practical guide for those embarking on the Hindu path of enlightenment. Descriptions of rather incredulous occurrences such as levitating may tend to obscure the relatively mundane disciplines of fasting, meditation, and prayer. A few of the incidents recalled involve Gandhi, offering a different view of him than we normally see. D.C.

If you're lucky, friends will be the protagonists in these multiple love stories. It's high time that we start seeing it that way."--NPR</strong> </p> <p> <strong>A personal and sociological examination--and ultimately a celebration--of the evolution of female friendship in pop culture and modern society</strong> </p> <p> "Text me when you get home." After joyful nights out together, female friends say this to one another as a way of cementing their love. It's about safety; but more than that, it's about solidarity. </p> <p> From <em>Broad City</em> to <em>Big Little Lies</em> to what women say about their own best friends, the stories we're telling about female friendship have changed. What used to be written off as infighting between mean girls or disposable relationships that would be tossed as soon as a guy came along are no longer described like that. Now, we're lifting up our female friendships to the same level as our other important relationships, saying they matter just as much as the bonds we have with our romantic partners, children, parents, or siblings. </p> <p> Journalist Kayleen Schaefer relays her journey of modern female friendship: from being a competitive teenager to trying to be one of the guys in the workplace to ultimately awakening to the power of female friendship and the soulmates, girl squads, and chosen families that come with it. </p> <p> Schaefer has put together a completely new sociological perspective on the way we see our friends today, one that includes interviews with dozens of other women across the country: historians, creators of the most iconic films and television shows about female friendship (and Galentine's Day!), celebrities, authors, and other experts. The end result is a validation of female friendship that's never existed before. </p></p><p><b>Kayleen Schaefer</b> is a journalist and author of the bestselling Kindle Single memoir <i>Fade Out</i>.

My mom stayed by herself in an apartment near the military base in Omaha, Nebraska. She had a job teaching Spanish to high school students, so during the day she went to work and at night she came home and wrote my dad a letter. "I made a promise that I would write every night," she says. A couple she and my dad had been friendly with looked after her, taking her to the movies or out to dinner, but "not weekly," she is quick to add.<br><br> She didn't have any other friends, or want any, which is inconceivable to me. It's not that I know my mom as someone who surrounded herself with girlfriends. I don't. But I assumed that at this point in her life, in her mid-twenties, by herself, states away from her parents and siblings, she'd at least have looked to other women for companionship and commiseration. Weren't there other women on the base whose husbands were in Vietnam? But she didn't.<br><br> "I never even thought of it," she says. "I didn't desire it. I concentrated on my teaching and wrote your dad letters. This was my way to support the effort in Vietnam. I had to be tough, and withstand anything; I couldn't be sad, or unhappy. I was just busy."<br><br> This is partly just my mom's personality. Being introspective, especially if that might turn into feeling depressed, is as unnatural to her as texting with her thumbs instead of her index fingers.<br><br> But her view on female friendships isn't unique among women of her generation. She's in her seventies now, and no longer feels like she has to soldier on being devoted only to her family. When she was a young wife and mother, she thought of friendships as an indulgence. They were nice, but not essential. What she was responsible for was taking care of her family, so she restrained herself from being interested in anything that would get in the way of that.<br><br> This was the contemporary view of how to live, at least if you were white and in the professional class, according to Judith E. Smith, a professor of American Studies at the University of Massachusetts Boston. "Heterosexual romance and the focus on the heterosexual couple is one of the hallmarks of being modern," she says. Men and women who had once looked for support from their friendships and extended families, even after they were married, now turned inward toward each other. My parents, who are white and upper-middle class, did exactly this. They believed the family unit superseded other relationships, and my early thinking that female friendships were superfluous came directly from their example and that of other families like ours in my hometown.<br><br> Some women, though, have always moved through the world together. In the mid-twentieth century, the professional class focused on their immediate families, but poorer, working-class women, who were white and non-white, continued to depend on larger networks, including relatives and female friends. They leaned on each other for help with childcare and finding jobs, and for companionship needs not met by sexual relationships. "People who were living from hand to mouth totally needed those additional relationships," Smith says.<br><br> At least in part because they couldn't afford not to, these women raised their friendships to the same level as other relationships in their lives. They took care of each other because it was necessary for survival.<br><br> My mom says she never felt lonely when she was a new wife, even though she didn�t have any girlfriends. It never quite made sense to me because she had friends before she got married, in childhood and college, and in her early twenties she shared a two-bedroom apartment in West Covina, California, with three other women who were also teachers. They became a foursome; everyone at school knew their group. �I think they noticed us because we were young, attractive, and single,� my mom says. My mom and one of her roommates carpooled together in the mornings. There was only one bathroom and never enough time, so every night before they went to sleep, the roommate yelled at my mom, �Are you shaving your legs tomorrow?� They went out to bars (my mom drank vodka gimlets) and on trips together, to San Francisco, Bear Mountain, and Honolulu, where they always shared one hotel room for the four of them, partly because they didn�t have much money and partly because it was more fun. �We were always talking late into the night,� she says. After three years, they all moved out. At first they sent a few letters back and forth, but eventually their only communication was through annual Christmas cards.<br><br> The writer Judy Blume, who is in her seventies, also moved away from her friends when she married, at twenty-one. She and her new husband lived on a cul-de-sac in New Jersey, where she "made this new life, at least that's what I thought we were doing, a life centered around my husband," she says. "That's what we did then. It may not have been true for everyone, but it was true for me."<br><br> But unlike my mom, Blume reports, "I was very lonely. I missed my girlfriends terribly, my women friends." She soon had two children to take care of, and her female neighbors were raising their own kids, which they did inside their own homes. Today when she's at her apartment in New York, she sees moms together, pushing strollers in the park or eating together at the kinds of lunch places that specialize in jam. "I think, Wow, that's so different from anything we did," she says. "Because we didn't go out."<br><br> One of the friends she missed was her best friend, Mary, whom she met in seventh grade, when they were twelve. In ninth grade, they dated the same guy. "We were both mad about this boy," Blume says. Instead of ruining their friendship, it gave them more in common. "We'd talk on the phone, like after she was out with him, after I was out with him," she says. "It was like, 'How many times did he kiss you?'"<br><br> When Blume lived in New Jersey with her husband, Mary lived in New York with hers, and the couples didn't socialize. "We'd married such different guys," Blume says. "Our husbands were never going to be friends."<br><br> She desperately wanted to find a friend like Mary in New Jersey. Whenever she saw a moving truck on the cul-de-sac, she'd think, This is going to be the one. I'm going to make a friend. She never did. "It just didn't turn out to be, and I can't tell you how lonely I was without my female friendships," Blume says.<br><br> Instead, she started to write fiction. Her first book, The One in the Middle Is the Green Kangaroo, was published in 1969, and Blume went on to write many beloved children's and young adult books, including Blubber, Deenie, and Are You There, God? It's Me, Margaret. "Writing saved my life," she says.<br><br> But her new career made it even harder for her to make friends with her neighbors. "I think it was more of the times than the women themselves," she says, "but there was something there in that neighborhood that, you know, there was a lot of, 'Who does she think she is, writing? What makes her think she can do this?' There was a lack of support that I had to get back in my life."<br><br> Throughout history, women have seen their bonds dismissed, picked apart, or outright mocked. Men from classical philosophers to religious leaders told women they had weak morals, which made it impossible for them to engage in friendship. Because of this, women may have been close, but they didn�t dare call themselves friends. �In the texts we have, you don�t find the word �friend� connected to women,� says Marilyn Sandidge, who coedited Friendship in the Middle Ages and Early Modern Age with Albrecht Classen. �There aren�t any women saying �my friend so and so.��<br><br> Only men used the word "friend" and only to talk about other men. Critics have said this means that women didn't rely on each other during this time, but "that's just absurd," according to Sandidge. Women were friends, but it's hard to find proof for two reasons, both having to do with how marginalized women were. First, they never wrote about themselves-men did the writing-so the documentation of their private lives was paltry. Men wrote what they thought about women or translated their thoughts. Catherine M. Mooney writes in Gendered Voices: Medieval Saints and Their Interpreters that women's words "almost invariably reach us only after having passed through the filters of their male confessors, patrons, and scribes." But Sandidge says when you look closely at how the men writing these books and documents describe what women are saying and doing, you can see that they do have close relationships with each other.<br><br> The second reason it's hard to point to these ties is that even if women suspected they were friends, men told them that was impossible. Women were too deceitful to relate to one another in the pure, selfless way men did.<br><br> Men believed their friendships helped them grow spiritually-they were based on being good to one another, behavior they assumed would bring them closer to God. Women, on the other hand, could never be so virtuous. "Only men were strong enough to maintain a serene, mostly rational, idealistic friendship with another person," Sandidge says.<br><br> All women could do, according to men, was mess up men's lives. Ever since Eve ate the forbidden fruit in the Garden of Eden, which got Adam and her kicked out, women have been cast as sex-crazed, evil-seeking troublemakers. If it weren't for us, men would never be tempted with sex, fight each other, or do anything else regrettable. Aristotle's breakdown of the elements in the human body, from about 330 BCE, continued this demonization of women. He saw females as cold and wet, categorizations that meant women were unstable and sexually threatening (males were the opposite, warm and dry). This thinking continued to resonate through the Middle Ages. "We have a lot of liquids coming out of us," Sandidge says. "Men thought that was gross. That is the heart of this misogyny and the reason we were seen as so sexual and dangerous."<br><br> In the Middle Ages, the single way it was acceptable for women to be friends was if they were cloistered in a monastery. "There they would be trained by the church and have their sex drive contained," Sandidge says. Those women could then maybe have the same kind of wholesome friendships men did.<br><br> As time went on, most men still didn't accept the concept of female friendship. In the seventeenth century, Katherine Philips, a poet who was known by the pseudonym Orinda, formed what she called "the Society of Friendship" anyway. Historians debate whether the group ever had formal meetings, but they did share poems, and most of what Philips wrote about was friendship between women.<br><br> One of her poems, "To My Excellent Lucasia, on Our Friendship," read in part:<br><br> But never had Orinda found<br><br> A soul till she found thine;<br><br> Which now inspires, cures and supplies,<br><br> And guides my darkened breast:<br><br> For thou art all that I can prize,<br><br> My joy, my life, my rest.<br><br> Some scholars have said Philips's work was about lesbianism, but others, like Sandidge, see platonic affection. In 1657, Philips wanted to clear up her confusion about why she seemed to have achieved these deep friendships even though men told her she couldn't. She wrote Jeremy Taylor, a religious leader, asking if he could help her understand what was going on. She felt like a true friend. Could she be one?<br><br> Taylor wrote back and published his response: "A Discourse of the Nature, Offices, and Measures of Friendship, with Rules of Conducting It, in a Letter to the Most Ingenious and Excellent Mrs. Katharine [sic] Philips."<br><br> His answer, summarized, was that unlike many other men, he was okay with women having friends. He writes, "Madam, you may see how much I differ from the morosity of those cynics, who would not admit your sex into the communities of a noble friendship." He goes on to talk about how devoted women can be. "A woman can love as passionately, and converse as pleasantly, and retain a secret as faithfully, and be useful in her proper ministries, and she can die for her friend as well as the bravest Roman knight," he writes.<br><br> Still, despite this, he concludes that Philips and all other women aren't as skilled at friendships as men are, simply because they're women. "I cannot say that women are capable of all of those excellences, by which men can oblige the world; and therefore a female friend in some cases is not so good a counsellor as a wise man," he writes.<br><br> This history helps explain how the idea that women can't trust each other, that we're better off forgoing friendship because eventually we're going to fail at it, became so intractable. Men told us not to rely on our own sex-and turn to them instead.<br><br> In my grandmother�s and mother�s generations, female friends met mostly through their husbands and children. What time they spent together was usually alongside a family member, if they joined a couples� group or dragged a toddler to afternoon tea. If they had a hobby in common, they might get together for it. In the 1950s in Sheboygan, Wisconsin, when my grandmother, Christine (my mom�s mother) was in her forties, she played the card game canasta with three other women every month. Other than that my mom doesn�t remember her having many friends. She had a husband and four children and was busy caring for them, cooking-every day, she made breakfast, lunch, and dinner-and doing laundry. On Mondays, she washed the clothes and then spent the rest of the week ironing them. �There was no such thing as not ironing then,� my mom says. �Whenever I came home from school, I usually found her ironing.� The women whom she talked with most regularly were other relatives, like her nephew�s wife, Betty, who would come by once in a while, or her sister-in-law Elaine, who called sometimes. On canasta nights, though, she�d have dinner with the family and then leave to join her friends, in a nice dress and heels. �I liked seeing my mom go out by herself,� my mom recalls. When the women came over to her house, my mom remembers them talking and laughing around a card table set up in the living room. �She seemed relaxed,� my mom says.</p><h2>The Klamath Knot</h2><p>Explores the mysteries of the Klamath Mountain region of northwestern California and southwestern Oregon</p><p></p><h2>Dragonsinger</h2><p>Menolly flees her home, because she is not permitted to make music there, and is taken by the Masterharper himself to Harpershall, where she learns that only her own self-doubt stands in her way</p><p>Anne McCaffrey was born in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

Ballard is a former United States Navy officer and a professor of oceanography at the University of Rhode Island who is most noted for his work in maritime archaeology. He discovered the sunken Titanic and Bismarck ships and is the author of many books about his discoveries, including The Discovery of the Titanic, Finding the Titanic, and Graveyards of the Pacific. He lives in Mystic, Connecticut.Grade 4-8 In straightforward prose, complemented by excellent illustrations, the story of the Titanic 's first and final voyage as well as that of her rediscovery and exploration is told. The text captures the drama of both the night of the sinking as well as that of the discovery of the great ship on the ocean floor. The technically accurate and lucid explanations are greatly enhanced by Marschall's stunning paintings, as well as by diagrams and current and period photographs. Giving a wealth of detail on both the Titanic 's sinking and the exploration of the wreck 74 years later, this is the title of choice for both report writing and browsing on this topic. Although the glossary is good, it does not cover all unfamiliar words. ``Funnel,'' for example, is not defined and may confuse readers who do not realize that this refers to the smokestack. This is a minor quibble, however, given the general excellence of the work. Exploring the Titanic gives more depth of coverage in better style than does John Dudman's The Sinking of the Titanic (Bookwright, 1988), and is more colorful and compelling than Frank Sloan's Titanic (Watts, 1987).

Theologians and historians of the Church have critically scrutinized the Gospel records to the point where their focus shifted almost entirely from the Christ being to the human man of flesh, Jesus of Nazareth. <br><br> Today, people are beginning a renewed search for an understanding of the life, death, and resurrection of Christ and the meaning of those events for life today. In these enlightening lectures, Steiner shows how the Mystery of Golgotha can be seen as the pivotal event of human history. The Gospels themselves, he says, are &#x201c;initiation documents&#x201d; that guide us along a path of spiritual development. <br><br> Steiner also demonstrates how manifold spiritual entities are involved in the events in Palestine two thousand years ago, and describes the problematic aspects of Christian theology, such as the resurrection of the physical body. And, throughout these talks, he emphasizes the esoteric path to Christ and encourages us to awaken to the new revelation manifesting in our time&#x2015;the Christ as &#x201c;Lord of Karma.&#x201d; <br><br> This edition also contains a public talk given prior to the beginning of the course.</p><p><b>Rudolf Steiner</b>&nbsp;(1861&#x2013;1925) was born in the small village of Kraljevec, Austro-Hungarian Empire (now in Croatia), where he grew up (see right). As a young man, he lived in Weimar and Berlin, where he became a well-published scientific, literary, and philosophical scholar, known especially for his work with Goethe&#x2019;s scientific writings. At the beginning of the twentieth century, he began to develop his early philosophical principles into an approach to systematic research into psychological and spiritual phenomena. Formally beginning his spiritual teaching career under the auspices of the Theosophical Society, Steiner came to use the term Anthroposophy (and spiritual science) for his philosophy, spiritual research, and findings. The influence of Steiner&#x2019;s multifaceted genius has led to innovative and holistic approaches in medicine, various therapies, philosophy, religious renewal, Waldorf education, education for special needs, threefold economics, biodynamic agriculture, Goethean science, architecture, and the arts of drama, speech, and eurythmy. In 1924, Rudolf Steiner founded the General Anthroposophical Society, which today has branches throughout the world.

There are decorative endpapers of the Abbey and gardens, an introduction to the Abbey of Westminster and a note on the life of Benedictine monks - all meticulously researched, written and illustrated with warmth and humour by Westminster Abbey's very own Head Gardener.'<i>Brother William's Year</i> by Jan Pancheri is a gorgeous book and offers an interesting lesson on medieval history for anyone. It will be useful not only for history lessons but also as away of demonstrating the 'journal writing' genre and the power of the first person voice. The print book is not in danger while works of this quality continue to be published by insightful publishers like Frances Lincoln.'- Dr Margaret Mallet, Judge of the English Association Awards</p></p><p>JAN PANCHERI has been Head Gardener at Westminster Abbey for the past five years and has made a study of the monks who lived there. She was brought up in Worcestershire. Her grandfather, an Italian immigrant, and her father were both woodcarvers. She qualified as an art teacher in 1989, and has written and illustrated two picture books, The Twelve Poodle Princesses and The Little Angel. She also runs children&#39;s summer workshops, and is passionate about introducing children to gardens, nature and the history around them.Narrated by a fourteenth-century monk, this lightly informative picture book takes readers through his activities during 12 months at Westminster Abbey: making &#x201c;a snowmonk and a snowdog&#x201d; in January; beginning his restricted Lenten diet in February; taking daffodils to a sick Brother in March; washing the feet of the poor on Maundy Thursday in April; welcoming novices to the monastery in May; napping in the garden on a sunny June afternoon, and so on. Every month is represented by several activities illustrated on a double-page spread with a number of small gouache paintings in a naive style. Two of the entries include modern recipes for medieval dishes, Lenten leek soup and cherry pottage. An appended note comments on the building of the monastery in Westminster, London, and aspects of a monk&#x2019;s life in 1383. Written and illustrated by the current head gardener at Westminster Abbey, this attractive picture book captures the rhythm of a monastery year.

In Roughing It, his fictionalized account of these years, tall tales abound, as do sketches of unforgettable characters: desperadoes, vigilantes, newspapermen, Mormons, and prospectors.<br><br> Twain's Debt to the burlesque styling of regional humorists and his celebrated gift for accurately rendering regional speech are never more in evidence than here, but as Hamlin Hill points out in his introduction, Roughing It must also be read as Twain's renunciation of his footloose bachelorhood, his rejection of the mythic, romanticized image of the West, and his autopsy of the American dream.<br><br>For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world. With more than 1,700 titles, Penguin Classics represents a global bookshelf of the best works throughout history and across genres and disciplines. Readers trust the series to provide authoritative texts enhanced by introductions and notes by distinguished scholars and contemporary authors, as well as up-to-date translations by award-winning translators.</p><p>There is no nicer surprise for a reader than to discover that an acknowledged classic really does deliver the goods. Mark Twain's <i>Roughing It</i> is just such a book. The adventure tale is a delight from start to finish and is just as engrossing today as it was 125 years ago when it first appeared. <p> <i>Roughing It</i> tells the true-ish escapades of Twain in the American West. Although he clearly "speaks with forked tongue," <i>Roughing It</i> is informative as well as humorous. From stagecoach travel to the etiquette of prospecting, the modern reader gains considerable insight into that much-fictionalized time and place. Do you know about sagebrush, for example? </p><blockquote> Sage-brush is very fair fuel, but as a vegetable it is a distinguished failure. Nothing can abide the taste of it but the jackass and his illegitimate child, the mule. But their testimony to its nutritiousness is worth nothing, for they will eat pine knots, or anthracite coal, or brass filings, or lead pipe, or old bottles, or anything that comes handy, and then go off looking as grateful as if they had had oysters for dinner. </blockquote> <i>Roughing It</i> is informally structured around the narrator's attempts to strike it rich. He meets a motley, colorful crew in the process; many mishaps occur, and it shouldn't surprise you that Twain does not emerge a man of means. But he withstands it all in such a relentless good humor that his misfortune inspires laughter. <i>Roughing It</i> is wonderful entertainment and reminds you how funny the world can be--even its grimmer districts--when you're traveling with the right writer.12 1.5-hour cassettes</p><h2>Triss (Redwall)</h2><p><b><i>New York Times</i> bestselling author Brian Jacques gives us another tales of Redwall, filled with&nbsp;&#x201c;The Knights of the Round Table with paws&#x201d; (<i>The Sunday Times) </i>along with their friends and enemies.</b><br><br>Brave squirrelmaid Triss plans a daring escape from the enslavement of the evil ferret King Agarnu and his daughter Princess Kurda...</p><p>Wot, Wot?! Could it be another epic Redwall tale (tail?) thick with high adventure, heavy accents, and leek-and-turnip pasty from the beloved beast master himself, Brian Jacques? It is indeed, happy readers. <i>Triss</i>, the 15th book in the distinguished and wildly popular animal fantasy series, chronicles the exploits of a brave squirrel maid who travels from the bonds of slavery to the meeting of her destiny as a warrior at Redwall Abbey. Triss the squirrel, Shogg the otter, and Welfo the hedgehog, all slaves to the bloodthirsty royal ferret family of Riftgard, filch a ferret boat and sail away from the murderous clutches of Princess Kurda and her malevolent father, King Agarnu. Swearing revenge, Kurda sets out to recapture her slaves, her evil Ratguard troops reinforced by the pirate fox Plugg Firetail and his band of criminal Freebooters. At the same time, the badger Sagaxus and his bosom friend Bescarum the hare also set sail from Salamanstrom, to seek adventure on the high seas. Meanwhile, back at the abbey, the Redwall inhabitants are being plagued by a mystery that involves a hidden door, a secret code, and three stinking, sinister snake siblings that are picking off the gentle forest folk one by one. Any ardent fan of Redwall knows that what comes next will include sword fights, feasting, raucous good humor, and a thrilling climax. Jacques's fervent followers are rewarded with the author's usual swashbuckling good storytelling, while the newly initiated will read with wide eyes, and quickly go back to hungrily devour the rest of the series.

Yet the tastes and eating pleasure of <i>seuppa ou piat</i> will be completely familiar and welcome to anyone who loves the gratineed crouton of French onion soup or enjoys a crispy grilled-cheese sandwich with a bowl of rich chicken broth alongside. This is a good dish for company, because you can have both the broth and the pasticciata hot and ready to be put together when your guests come. (Chicken stock is my preference, but a savory vegetable stock or a meaty beef broth is just as good.) <i>--Lidia Bastianich</i></p> <p><b>Ingredients</b></p> <ul> <li>8 cups tasty chicken broth (or clear beef or vegetable stock)</li> <li>Kosher salt to taste</li> <li>1 tablespoon soft butter for the baking dish</li> <li>1/2 pound fontina from Valle d'Aosta (or Italian Fontal)</li> <li>1 cup freshly grated Grana Padano or Parmigiano- Reggiano, plus more for passing</li> <li>18 slices Italian bread, cut 1/2 inch thick from a long oval loaf, left out to dry overnight*</li> </ul> <p>Recommended Equipment: A baking dish or oval gratin dish, 3 quarts or larger; heavy aluminum foil </p> <p><b>Directions</b></p> <p>Arrange a rack in the middle of the oven, and heat to 400 degrees. Heat the broth almost to a simmer--season with salt to taste--and keep it hot. Butter the sides and bottom of the baking dish. Shred the fontina through the larger holes of a hand grater and toss the shreds with the grana (grated hard cheese).</p> <p>Arrange half of the bread slices in one layer in the baking dish. Ladle out 1 cup of broth, and drizzle it on the bread slices, slightly moistening them all. Sprinkle half of the cheese on top of the bread in an even layer. Cover the cheese with the remaining bread slices, filling the entire surface of the dish. Moisten these slices with another cup or so of stock; top the bread with all the remaining cheese, scattered evenly.</p> <p>Tent the pasticciata with a sheet of heavy aluminum foil, arching it so it doesn&#x2019;t touch the cheese topping, and pressing it against the sides of the baking dish. Set the dish in the oven, and bake until heated through, about 25 minutes. Remove the foil, and continue baking for 10 minutes or more, until the top is golden brown and bubbly. Take the dish from the oven, and let it cool and set for 5 minutes or so.</p> <p>To serve: Cut out large squares of pasticciata and, with a spatula, transfer them to warm shallow soup or pasta bowls. Ladle a cup of hot broth over each portion and serve immediately, passing more grated cheese at the table.</p> <p><i>*Country Italian bread is best for this pasticciata. The width of the bread can vary since it is layered snugly in the baking dish, then cut in squares when served.</i></p>Lidia Matticchio Bastianich is the author of five previous books, four of them accompanied by nationally syndicated public television series.

In the stories, they only come for the wild maiden.&#39;In a village at the edge of the wilderness of northern Russia, where the winds blow cold and the snow falls many months of the year, an elderly servant tells stories of sorcery, folklore and the Winter King to the children of the family, tales of old magic frowned upon by the church.But for the young, wild Vasya these are far more than just stories. She alone can see the house spirits that guard her home, and sense the growing forces of dark magic in the woods... Atmospheric and enchanting, with an engrossing adventure at its core, The Bear and the Nightingale is perfect for readers of Naomi Novik&#39;s Uprooted, Erin Morgenstern&#39;s The Night Circus, and Neil Gaiman.</p><p><strong>An Amazon Best Book of January 2017:</strong> There's a small but mighty space where fantasy and literary fiction can clasp hands and create a brilliant story that resonates in the soul. <em>The Bear and the Nightingale</em> lives squarely in that space, and those who dare to visit this novel will leave entranced. Set in the fourteenth century in the bitter north, a two-week ride from the rough city of Moscow, this mesmerizing tale centers on Vasya Petronova, a girl who barely survives birth (her mother doesn't) and grows up with a secret affinity for the sprites and demons that live in and around her village. "A wild thing new-caught and just barely groomed into submission" is how her father imagines her, and he's not wrong. As her family tries to harness her into the typical domestic life of a young noblewoman, Vasya spends more and more time among the sprites and soon gets caught between two old and powerful gods struggling for domination over her part of the world. Arden's debut novel builds like a thunderstorm, with far-off disquieting rumblings that escalate into a clash between sprites and humans, ancient religions and new, honor and ambition. If you haven't picked up a Russian-style novel lately, it can take a few chapters to recall that each character has a handful of nicknames you have to keep track of and that various storylines may take their time in weaving back into the main plot, but it's well worth the effort. And while I think there are only a dozen or so novels in this world that have a perfect ending, I would put <em>The Bear and the Nightingale</em> high on that list. <em>--Adrian Liang, The Amazon Book Review</em>Born in Austin, Texas, Katherine Arden spent her junior year of high school in Rennes, France.

This extensive anthology allows readers to peer into the mind of genius by providing them with excerpts from the original mathematical proofs and results. It also helps them understand the progression of mathematical thought, and the very foundations of our present-day technologies. Each chapter begins with a biography of the featured mathematician, clearly explaining the significance of the result, followed by the full proof of the work, reproduced from the original publication.</p><p>"God created the integers," wrote mathematician Leopold Kronecker, "All the rest is the work of Man." In this collection of landmark mathematical works, editor Stephen Hawking has assembled the greatest feats humans have ever accomplished using just numbers and their brains. Each of the 17 sections opens with a historical introduction of the featured author, and proceeds to a faithful translation of their most famous work. While most mathematicians will already have complete editions of Isaac Newton's <i>Principia</i> or Georg Cantor's <i>Contributions to the Founding of the Theory of Transfinite Numbers</i>, this book is unique in presenting just the best bits of these and other theoretical works. The collection spans 2,500 years and covers a vast range of theories: the parallel postulate, Boolean logic, differential calculus, and the philosophy of the unknowable among them. Dense with numbers, formulae, and ideas, <i>God Created the Integers</i> is quite challenging, but Hawking rewards curious readers with a look at how mathematics has been built. In contrast to the towering physical edifices of great civilizations of the past, Hawking writes, "The greatest wonder of the modern world is our understanding." <i>--Therese Littleton</i><b>Stephen Hawking</b>'s ability to make science understandable and compelling to a lay audience was established with the publication of his first book, <i>A Brief History of Time</i>, which has sold nearly 10 million copies in 40 languages.

Appearing in an English-language paperback edition for the first time, volume 1 analyzes in vivid detail the military tactics and strategies used by the great warriors of antiquity. Delbr�ck disputes some points in classical history and separates fact from legend in his objective reconstruction of celebrated battles stretching from the Persian Wars to the Peloponnesian War, Alexander's campaign to conquer Asia, the Second Punic War and Hannibal's crossing of the Alps, and the triumph of the Roman legions and Julius Caesar. Walter J. Renfroe Jr. based his much-praised English translation on the third (1920) edition of volume 1.</p><p>"Delbr�ck is internationally regarded as the first modern military historian. <i>History of the Art of War</i>, considered a classic, is his foundational achievement.

If you've read Dav Pilkey's first two comic epics, <i>The Adventures of Captain Underpants</i> and <i>Captain Underpants and the Attack of the Talking Toilets</i>, you already know the brave Captain is really just crabby old Principal Krupp, hypnotized into becoming the world's greatest superhero every time someone snaps their fingers. And <i>of course</i> you know the trouble-making hypnotists are none other than Jerome Horwitz Elementary School's two most notorious tricksters, George and Harold ("We rule!" "Me, too!").<p> Well, George and Harold--surprise, surprise--are at it again. The cranky lunch ladies quit after George and Harold fool them into baking super-volcanic krispy kupcakes that flood the school with gigantic green globs o' goo. Mr. Krupp finds replacements and fast, but he unwittingly hires the tentacled alien trio of Zorx, Klax, and Jennifer in disguise! Will they turn everyone in school into evil zombie nerds? Can George and Harold save the world before it's too late? All seems lost until the diabolical Zorx snaps his... um, tentacles in front of Mr. Krupp, and the power of wedgies comes to the rescue once again.</p><p> Captain Underpants's third outing is better than ever, with patented Flip-o-Rama animation and wacky bonus comics like "Captain Underpants--Wedgie Wars" and "Captain Underpants and the Night of the Living Lunch Ladies."

Didn&#x2019;t want to be suspected of knowing anything about stuff like that. Especially if you had a brother or a friend of your brother who did it. Shoot horse. Even the girls didn&#x2019;t say anything. The policeman shook the bag.<br>&#x201c;Baking powder, do you think? Flour?&#x201d;<br>A mumble of answers in the negative. They didn&#x2019;t want him to think class 6B was a bunch of idiots. Even though it was impossible to determine what was really in the bag, this lesson was about drugs, so you could draw certain conclusions. The policeman turned to the teacher.<br>&#x201c;What do you teach them in Home Economics these days?&#x201d;<br>The teacher smiled and shrugged her shoulders. The class laughed; the cop was OK. Some of the guys had even been allowed to touch his gun before class. It wasn&#x2019;t loaded, but still.<br>Oskar&#x2019;s chest felt like it was about to burst. He knew the answer to the question. It hurt him not to say anything when he knew. He wanted the policeman to look at him. Look at him and tell him he was right. He knew it was a dumb thing to do, but he still put his hand up.<br>&#x201c;Yes?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s heroin, isn&#x2019;t it?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;In fact it is.&#x201d; The policeman looked kindly at him. &#x201c;How did you know?&#x201d;<br>Heads turned in his direction, curious as to what he was going to say.<br>&#x201c;Naw ... I mean, I&#x2019;ve read a lot and stuff.&#x201d;<br>The policeman nodded.<br>&#x201c;Now there&#x2019;s a good thing. Reading.&#x201d; He shook the little bag. &#x201c;You won&#x2019;t have much time for it if you get into this, though. How much do you think this little bag is worth?&#x201d;<br>Oskar didn&#x2019;t feel the need to say anything else. He had been looked at and spoken to. Had even been able to tell the cop he read a lot. That was more than he had hoped for.<br>He let himself sink into a daydream. How the policeman came up to him after class and was interested in him, sat down next to him. Then he would tell him everything. And the policeman would understand. He would stroke his hair and tell him he was alright; would hold him and say ...<br>&#x201c;Fucking snitch.&#x201d;<br>Jonny Forsberg drove a hard finger into his side. Jonny&#x2019;s brother ran with the drug crowd and Jonny knew a lot of words that the other guys in the class quickly picked up. Jonny probably knew exactly how much that bag was worth but he didn&#x2019;t snitch. Didn&#x2019;t talk to the cop.<br>It was recess and Oskar lingered by the coat rack, indecisive. Jonny wanted to hurt him&#x2014;what was the best way to avoid it? By staying here in the hallway or going outside? Jonny and the other class members stormed out the doors into the schoolyard.<br>That&#x2019;s right; the policeman had his car parked in the schoolyard and anyone who was interested could come take a look. Jonny wouldn&#x2019;t dare beat him up when the policeman was there.<br>Oskar walked down to the double front doors and looked out the glass window. Just as he thought, everyone in the class had gathered around the patrol car. Oskar would also have wanted to be there but there was no point. Someone would knee him, another pull his underpants up in a wedgie, policeman or no policeman.<br>But at least he was off the hook this recess. He went out into the schoolyard and snuck around the back of the building, to the bathrooms.<br>Once he was in the bathroom he listened, cleared his throat. The sound echoed through the stalls. He reached his hand into his underpants and quickly pulled out the Pissball, a piece of foam about the size of a clementine that he had cut out of an old mattress and put a hole in for his penis. He smelled it.<br>Yup, he had pissed in his pants again. He rinsed it under the tap, squeezing out as much water as possible.<br>Incontinence. That was what it was called. He had read about it in a pamphlet that he had sneaked from the drugstore. Mostly something old women suffered from.<br>And me.<br>There were prescription medicines you could get, it said in the pamphlet, but he did not intend to use his allowance so he could humiliate himself at the prescription counter. And he would definitely not tell his mother; she would feel so sorry for him it would make him sick.<br>He had the Pissball and it worked for now.<br>Footsteps outside, voices. Pissball in hand, he fled into the nearest stall and locked the door at the same time as the outer door opened. He soundlessly climbed up onto the toilet seat, curling into a ball so his feet wouldn&#x2019;t show if anyone looked under the door. Tried not to breathe.<br>&#x201c;Pig-gy?&#x201d;<br>Jonny, of course.<br>&#x201c;Hey Piggy, are you here?&#x201d;<br>Micke was with him. The worst two of the lot. No, Tomas was worse but he was almost never in on stuff that involved physical blows and scratches. Too smart for that. Was probably sucking up to the policeman right now. If the Pissball were discovered, Tomas was the one who would really be able to use it to hurt and humiliate him for a long time. Jonny and Micke, on the other hand, would just beat him up and that was fine with him. So in a way he was actually lucky. ...<br>&#x201c;Piggy? We know you&#x2019;re in here.&#x201d;<br>They checked his stall. Shook the door. Banged on it. Oskar wrapped his arms tightly around his legs and clenched his teeth so he wouldn&#x2019;t scream.<br>Go away! Leave me alone! Why can&#x2019;t you leave me alone?<br>Now Jonny was talking in a mild voice.<br>&#x201c;Little Pig, if you don&#x2019;t come out now we have to get you after school. Is that what you want?&#x201d;<br>It was quiet for a while. Oskar exhaled carefully.<br>They attacked the door with kicks and blows. The whole bathroom thundered and the lock on the stall door started to bend inward. He should open it, go out to them before they got too mad, but he just couldn&#x2019;t.<br>&#x201c;Pi-ggy?&#x201d;<br>He had put his hand up in class, a declaration of existence, a claim that he knew something. And that was forbidden to him. They could give a number of reasons for why they had to torment him; he was too fat, too ugly, too disgusting. But the real problem was simply that he existed, and every reminder of his existence was a crime.<br>They were probably just going to &#x201c;baptize&#x201d; him. Shove his head into the toilet bowl and flush. Regardless of what they invented, it was always such a relief when it was over. So why couldn&#x2019;t he just pull back the lock, that was in any case going to tear off at the hinges at any moment, and let them have their fun?<br>He stared at the bolt that was forced out of the lock with a crack, at the door that flung open and banged into the wall, at Micke Siskov&#x2019;s triumphantly smiling face, and then he knew.<br>That wasn&#x2019;t the way the game was played.<br>He couldn&#x2019;t have pulled back the lock, they couldn&#x2019;t simply have climbed over the sides of the stall in all of three seconds, because those weren&#x2019;t the rules of the game.<br>Theirs was the intoxication of the hunter, his the terror of the prey. Once they had actually captured him the fun was over and the punishment more of a duty that had to be carried out. If he gave up too early there was a chance they would put more of their energy into the punishment instead of the hunt. That would be worse.<br>Jonny Forsberg stuck his head in.<br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ll have to open the lid if you&#x2019;re going to shit, you know. Go on, squeal like a pig.&#x201d;<br>And Oskar squealed like a pig. That was a part of it. If he squealed they would sometimes leave it at that. He put extra effort into it this time, afraid they would otherwise force his hand out of his pants in the process of punishing him and uncover his disgusting secret.<br>He wrinkled up his nose like a pig&#x2019;s and squealed; grunted and squealed. Jonny and Micke laughed.<br>&#x201c;Fucking pig, go on, squeal some more.&#x201d;<br>Oskar carried on. Shut his eyes tight and kept going. Balled his hands up into fists so hard that his nails went into his palms, and kept going. Grunted and squealed until he felt a funny taste in his mouth. Then he stopped and opened his eyes.<br>They were gone.<br>He stayed put, curled up on the toilet seat, and stared down at the floor. There was a red spot on the tile below. While he was watching, another drop fell from his nose. He tore off a piece of toilet paper and held it against his nostril.<br>This sometimes happened when he was scared. His nose started to bleed, just like that. It had helped him a few times when they were thinking about hitting him, and decided against it since he was already bleeding.<br>Oskar Eriksson sat there curled up with a wad of paper in one hand and his Pissball in the other. Got nosebleeds, wet his pants, talked too much. Leaked from every orifice. Soon he would probably start to shit his pants as well. Piggy.<br>He got up and left the bathroom. Didn&#x2019;t wipe up the drop of blood. Let someone see it, let them wonder. Let them think someone had been killed here, because someone had been killed here. And for the hundreth time.<br>H�kan Bengtsson, a forty-five-year-old man with an incipient beer belly, a receding hairline, and an address unknown to the authorities, was sitting on the subway, staring out of the window at what was to be his new home.<br>It was a little ugly, actually.

Our side had won, a verdict that was both decisive and irreversible. For the world&#x2019;s &#x201c;indispensable nation,&#x201d; its &#x201c;sole superpower,&#x201d; the future looked very bright. History, having brought the United States to the very summit of power and prestige, had validated American-style liberal democratic capitalism as universally applicable.</p><p>In the decades to come, Americans would put that claim to the test. They would embrace the promise of globalization as a source of unprecedented wealth while embarking on wide-ranging military campaigns to suppress disorder and enforce American values abroad, confident in the ability of U.S. forces to defeat any foe.

They include <i> Degas and the Little Dancer, Leonardo and the Flying Boy, The Magical Garden of Claude Monet, </i> and <i> van Gogh and the Sunflowers. </i>Anholt (Camille and the Sunflowers) continues his imaginative series about great artists with this cleverly executed and engaging account of one of Leonardo da Vinci's real-life apprentices. When Leonardo tells Zoro that one day "people will sail through the clouds and look down at the world below," the boy believes him. After all, "anything seemed possible in Leonardo's busy studio." But when Zoro and Salai, a mischievous urchin Leonardo has taken in (also seen in Guido Visconti and Bimba Landmann's The Genius of Leonardo, reviewed Sept. 18), sneak into their master's secret workshop and take his flying machine for a spin, there's trouble ahead. The story is relayed with verve, and the spry colored-pencil drawings that detail Zoro's escapades boast numerous comic touches (such as Leonardo nearly tripping over his oversize red slippers in his haste to get back to his studio when struck by inspiration) and sly references to Leonardo's body of work (backward writing on the endpapers; copies of his botanical drawings, inventions and character studies; even a Mona Lisa reproduction).

She fondly recalls her growing-up years, and due to a keen interest in her mother's Plain family heritage, many of Beverly's books are set in Lancaster County.<br>A former schoolteacher, Bev is a member of The National League of American Pen Women�the Pikes Peak Branch�and the Society of Children's Book Writers and Illustrators. Her bestselling books are among the C.S. Lewis Noteworthy List Books, and both The Postcard and Annika's Secret Wish have received Silver Angel Awards. Bev and her husband have three children and make their home in Colorado.It's a family reunion of sorts in Lewis's newest offering, a story collection in three parts to update her devotees on the progress of the Amish and "fancy Englischer" characters in her previous novels, all held together by the common thread of their Pennsylvania Dutch country setting. "Hickory Hollow" describes Katie and Daniel's wedded bliss (The Heritage of Lancaster County series) and Katie's overtures toward her family and church friends, who have shunned her. We find the characters from The Postcard, Rachel and her husband, Philip (a former "fancy Englischer"), settled into family life in Bird-in-Hand. Philip struggles to gain acceptance from his Amish peers as he helps to fight a fire and tries his hand at a barn raising. In "Grasshopper," we are brought up to speed on Lydia's courtship by Levi (from The Redemption of Sarah Cain). Although the book is touted as "perfect for Lewis fans and new readers," it would be a tough introduction for someone unfamiliar with her work. The dialect "wonderful-gut," "redding," "perty" and "jah" can make the reading as slow as molasses for the uninitiated. One wonders why each of these vignettes wasn't a full-fledged sequel; it feels a bit like Lewis threw three unfinished novels into one book. But Lewis fans will be pleased to find the same consistent writing they've come to enjoy, and to catch glimpses of how their favorite characters are faring. (Oct.)Forecast: Although many critics find Lewis's Amish-themed novels as overly sweet as shoofly pie, her fans are loyal and legion. More than three million copies of her books are now in print. Her followers will enjoy this, jah.<p></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>The Girl in The Tower: (Winternight Trilogy) [Paperback] Arden, Katherine</h2><p>BRAND NEW, Exactly same ISBN as listed, Please double check ISBN carefully before ordering.</p><p></p><h2>Galileo&#39;s Middle Finger: Heretics, Activists, and the Search for Justice in Science</h2><p><b><i>New York Times Book Review&nbsp;</i><br>"[S]mart, delightful... a splendidly entertaining education in ethics, activism and science.&#x201d;<br><br>Editors's Choice, <i>New York Times Book Review</i></b><br><br>An impassioned defense of intellectual freedom and a clarion call to intellectual responsibility, <i>Galileo&#x2019;s Middle Finger</i> is one American&#x2019;s eye-opening story of life in the trenches of scientific controversy. For two decades, historian Alice Dreger has led a life of extraordinary engagement, combining activist service to victims of unethical medical research with defense of scientists whose work has outraged identity politics activists. With spirit and wit, Dreger offers in<i> Galileo&#x2019;s Middle Finger </i>an unforgettable vision of the importance of rigorous truth seeking in today&#x2019;s America, where both the free press and free scholarly inquiry struggle under dire economic and political threats.<br><br>This illuminating chronicle begins with Dreger&#x2019;s own research into the treatment of people born intersex (once called hermaphrodites). Realization of the shocking surgical and ethical abuses conducted in the name of &#x201c;normalizing&#x201d; intersex children&#x2019;s gender identities moved Dreger to become an internationally recognized patient rights&#x2019; activist. But even as the intersex rights movement succeeded, Dreger began to realize how some fellow progressive activists were employing lies and personal attacks to silence scientists whose data revealed uncomfortable truths about humans. In researching one such case, Dreger suddenly became the target of just these kinds of attacks.<br><br>Troubled, she decided to try to understand more&#x2014;to travel the country to ferret out the truth behind various controversies, to obtain a global view of the nature and costs of these battles. <i>Galileo&#x2019;s Middle Finger</i> describes Dreger&#x2019;s long and harrowing journeys between the two camps for which she felt equal empathy: social justice activists determined to win and researchers determined to put hard truths before comfort. Ultimately what emerges is a lesson about the intertwining of justice and of truth&#x2014;and a lesson of the importance of responsible scholars and journalists to our fragile democracy.<br><br><b><i>Booklist&nbsp;</i>(starred review)</b><br>"<b>A crusader in the mold of muckrackers from a century ago</b>, Dreger doesn&#x2019;t try to hide her politics or her agenda.

But first I have to tell you a little bit about how I got into this mess. And explain why I think we now have a very dangerous situation on our hands.</p><p>As an academic historian who typically hangs out with her own political kind, I&#x2019;m aware of the stereotype many liberals have about conservative Catholics. The former believe the latter don&#x2019;t think&#x2014;that conservative religious people don&#x2019;t care about facts and rigorous inquiry. But my conservative Catholic parents <i>were</i> thinkers. Twice as often as my parents told their four children to go wash, they told us to go look something up. At our suburban tract house on Long Island in the 1970s, our parents shelved the <i>Encyclop�dia Britannica</i> right next to the dinner table so we could easily reach for a volume to settle the frequent debates. The rotating stack of periodicals in our kitchen included not only religiously oriented newsletters, but also the<i> New York Times</i> and <i>National Geographic</i>. Our parents took us to science museums, woke us up for lunar eclipses, and pushed us to question our textbooks and even our teachers when they sounded wrong. Although our mother never mentioned that she had earned a degree in philosophy from Hunter College, she read to us aloud from Plato and Shakespeare, analyzing the texts as she read. Meanwhile, our father, a draftsman for one of the big Long Island defense contractors, loved learning in spite of having had only a high school education. We joked that he would someday be crushed under his books, most of them military histories of Poland, the homeland of both sides of our family. He got us microscopes and telescopes and talked seriously about the potential for alien life-forms. I vividly recall that, when one day we summoned him urgently to come see a giant UFO that had appeared in the sky, he was genuinely disappointed to discover he had bothered to grab his camera for the Goodyear blimp.</p><p>But besides being intellectuals and knowledge seekers, my parents were also industrial-strength Roman Catholics. They sought out Latin masses and avoided meat on Fridays long after Vatican II declared all that fuss unnecessary. They sent us to public school not only because the local public schools offered the best education around, but also because the local Catholic school struck them as dangerously liberal in its religious orientation. (Better to be among Protestants and Jews than roomfuls of squishy Catholics.) Their religious devotion manifested itself largely in pro-life activism. Even while their own children were still young and underfoot, my parents collected baby things to give to poor mothers, took in a young pregnant woman who had been thrown out by her parents, and became foster parents to a mixed-race baby of a single mother, ultimately adopting that child. As we were growing up, the basement of our house slowly filled with homemade placards we would carry when marching outside abortion clinics.</p><p>Although they were highly obedient to authority in their religious lives, in their political lives, my parents were rabble-rousers. My father ran for Congress on the Right-to-Life Party line, while my mother helped lead the local chapter of Feminists for Life. (In the 1970s, bra-burning pro-lifers were a real thing.) My mother especially embraced her American rights to speak, to assemble, to vote, and to protest, because she knew her life might well have turned out differently. Born in 1935 in Poland, she had somehow survived the Second World War with her extended family in their tiny farming village in an area subjected to repeated aerial bombings and ground-war skirmishes. Not long after the war ended, at the age of eleven, she had been suddenly transported with her brother and mother to America, where the three of them were reunited with her father. (Her father had had dual citizenship and had fought with the Americans.) On these shores, she found a land where you could, <i>without fear</i>, say and think what you wanted, worship and vote as you wanted, and openly object to what you found stupid or offensive. She let us know, as we were growing up, that she considered American democracy a true wonder, a tool to be used at every chance. The Bill of Rights seemed to her almost as sacred as the Bible. This view was implicitly and explicitly reinforced by the rare relatives who made it out of Soviet-controlled Poland and came to lodge with us.</p><p>My parents never seemed to feel a tension between these heavy strands that comprised their lives&#x2014;the Old World and the New, the religious and the intellectual, the obedient and the activist. I suppose that to them it all seemed obviously interrelated. They had no trouble sending me to confession one day and renewing my subscription to <i>Natural History</i> magazine the next. But as I grew up, I felt the tension one surely <i>must</i> feel when being simultaneously taught the importance of a specific dogma and the importance of freedom <i>from</i> dogma.</p><p>I knew that some people abandoned their parents&#x2019; religion as a way of asserting their independence. But for me, losing my religion wasn&#x2019;t about rebellion against my parents; indeed, I felt quite forlorn at the idea of disappointing my family by admitting my atheism. Still, my parents&#x2019; religious faith seemed to me incommensurate with our deeply felt faith in America&#x2014;a faith in freedom of inquiry, in freedom of thought, in the will and right of the people to collectively discover truth and to make their own rules accordingly. And I loved America much more than I loved the Vatican, that place where celibate old men had the right to tell intelligent women what we should think and do. By the time I was in my late teens, while my sister was on her way to becoming a nun, I couldn&#x2019;t help but notice that the place I felt the hope of salvation wasn&#x2019;t church. It was the American Museum of Natural History, that great cathedral of evolution. As often as I could, I would take the train into New York City and lie under the giant blue whale in the great darkened hall of ocean life. Every time I lay there&#x2014;waiting for the delicious moment when the whale started to move, from optical illusion&#x2014;science struck me as the obvious and perhaps only way to remain perpetually free from blinding, oppressive dogma.</p><p>I guess, then, it is not too surprising that I ultimately decided to pursue a PhD in the history and philosophy of science, at Indiana University. Exploring the very life and guts of science by studying the history and the philosophy of it&#x2014;<i>this</i> seemed to me the way to make sure that the most antidogmatic way of life we had available to us, the scientific way of life, would remain healthy and vigorous. But by the time I moved to Bloomington for graduate school, in 1990, not everyone in the academic fields of science studies (the history, philosophy, and sociology of science) felt the same devotion. At that point, Marxist and feminist science-studies scholars had for almost two decades been producing a large body of work deeply critical of various scientific claims and practices. They had shown how various scientists had, in word and deed, oppressed women, people of color, and poor folks, typically by making problematic &#x201c;scientific&#x201d; claims about them. Harvard biologist Ruth Hubbard, for example, had taken apart pseudoscientific claims that biology made women &#x201c;naturally&#x201d; less capable of doing science than men. Historians like Londa Schiebinger and Cynthia Eagle Russett had documented how, over many centuries, patriarchies had deployed the rhetoric of science to represent women as inherently inferior to men. Meanwhile, Hubbard&#x2019;s Harvard colleague Stephen Jay Gould had scrutinized &#x201c;scientific&#x201d; studies purporting to show important racial differences in skull size and IQ and had shown them to be hopelessly riddled with racist bias.</p><p>Make no mistake: As a liberal feminist, I <i>was</i> extremely sympathetic to feminist and Marxist science studies. Indeed, the work of scholars like Gould&#x2014;whose columns in <i>Natural History</i> I had devoured as a teenager&#x2014;struck me as constituting perhaps the most important work of social justice of our time, because it challenged racist and sexist claims about human nature. These leftist criticisms were part of what drove me to graduate school. But to me at least, the finding by Gould and others that scientists often suffered from bias didn&#x2019;t mean science <i>itself</i> was rotten. The very fact that scholars could <i>see and show</i> problems of racist and sexist bias in science stood to me as proof that, together, evidence-driven scholars could advance knowledge and ultimately get past the individual human mind&#x2019;s tendency to follow familiar scripts. If some of the products of science disappointed me, the process most assuredly did not. Indeed, in graduate school, I gravitated toward historical work specifically because I loved the relatively scientific process in history of seeking, organizing, and analyzing evidence&#x2014;of letting the data guide you toward new and unexpected learning, as much as humanly possible.</p><p>&nbsp;�&nbsp;�&nbsp;�&nbsp;</p><p>IN GRADUATE SCHOOL, I ended up cutting my scholarly teeth on the history of the biomedical treatment of people born with sex anomalies&#x2014;the people who used to be called hermaphrodites. For many years, people would assume I had a personal stake in this identity issue&#x2014;that I or someone I loved had been born hermaphroditic&#x2014;but in fact this topic was simply suggested to me by my dissertation director, who saw it as a great way to examine &#x201c;scientific&#x201d; conceptions of gender, something that fascinated me as a feminist. To be honest, in looking into the history of hermaphroditism, I decided to focus on the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries because I figured I&#x2019;d find easy pickings there. I already knew that most doctors of that time were politically conservative men, inclined to believe that the unequal social treatment of women arose from&#x2014;nay, was <i>required</i> by&#x2014;the allegedly natural two-sex divide. I knew there would have been a lot at stake for one of these sexist doctors when a patient appeared on inspection to be a hermaphrodite. Some of these patients had immediately apparent mixes of male and female traits&#x2014;a notable phallus and a vaginal opening or feminine breasts along with a full beard. Others appeared to have one sex externally but the opposite internally. All unwittingly challenged the idea that there were only two real sexes&#x2014;that there was a clear, natural divide between men and women.</p><p>Just as I was finishing my PhD, in 1995, I published my first scholarly paper, in the journal <i>Victorian Studies</i>. This article mapped out a hitherto uncharted history: what Victorian British doctors had done when faced with living proof that humans don&#x2019;t come in only two sexes.Though my report contained some grainy 1890s photographs of ambiguous genitalia, it was still pretty academic, showing no real hint of the odd path the paper&#x2019;s publication would lead me down. My finding was simply that Victorian doctors, befuddled by cases of &#x201c;doubtful sex,&#x201d; had deployed pragmatic combinations of clever rhetorical strategies, new scientific tools like microscopes, and the occasional surgical scalpel to try to make &#x201c;true hermaphroditism&#x201d; virtually disappear, all to protect long-standing social distinctions between men and women. But dry as that article may have been, it ended up pushing me into two unfamiliar and intense worlds: contemporary sex politics and contemporary medical activism. That&#x2019;s because, thanks to the Internet, by the time I came to this topic, in the mid-1990s, something was going on that the Victorian doctors would never have imagined: People who had been born with various sex anomalies had started to find each other, and they had started to organize as an identity rights movement.</p><p>Labeling themselves <i>intersex,</i> many gathered under the leadership of Bo Laurent, the founder of the Intersex Society of North America, and after reading my <i>Victorian Studies</i> article, some of these intersex activists, including Bo, contacted me. A couple wrote me simply to complain that they found some of my language offensive, apparently not realizing I was relaying Victorian rhetoric in my article. By contrast, Bo got my work. And she asked for my help in changing the way children born intersex were treated in modern medicine.</p><p>Now, as a straight, sex-typical female earning degrees in history and philosophy, I had started working in this field not only rather uneducated about human sex anatomy, but also rather uneducated about the politics of contemporary medicine. Still, it didn&#x2019;t take long for me to see the ways that our present-day medical system was indeed as broken as Bo and her compatriots were describing. Indeed, the system being employed at the children&#x2019;s hospital down the street from my grad-school apartment made the Victorian approach look relatively benign. The modern system featured not only highly aggressive cosmetic genital surgeries in infancy for children born with &#x201c;socially inappropriate&#x201d; genital variations like big clitorises, but also the withholding of diagnoses from patients and parents out of fear that they couldn&#x2019;t handle the truth. It treated boys born with small penises as hopeless cases who &#x201c;had&#x201d; to be castrated and sex-changed into girls, and it assumed that the ultimate ability of girls to reproduce as mothers should take precedence over all else, including the ability to someday experience orgasm.</p><p>I hastened to tell Bo, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m a historian; I study <i>dead</i> people.&#x201d; However, once I understood what was really going on at pediatric hospitals all over the nation&#x2014;once I understood that Bo&#x2019;s clitoris had been amputated in the name of sex &#x201c;normalcy&#x201d; and that this practice was still going on&#x2014;I felt I had to assist in her efforts. I had been raised to be an activist and to be someone who helps people in desperate circumstances, and I was stunned and outraged by what was going on. I threw myself into the struggle and spent the decade after grad school living two lives&#x2014;as a professor researching and writing academic histories of the medical establishment&#x2019;s treatment of intersex and also as a patient advocate and a leading activist for the rights of sexual minorities. By day, I was your typical history professor&#x2014;researching, teaching, and dealing with committee assignments. By night, I was campaigning to stop unnecessary and harmful genital surgeries, ill-advised sex changes on babies, and the well-meaning lies told to affected families. I held fund-raisers, I drafted press releases, I developed policies, I wrote and ghost-wrote propaganda, and I stuffed a lot of envelopes. I also testified to governmental committees, met with groups of activists and doctors, got media training, and appeared as a talking head on one news program after another.</p><p>I found the advocacy work so meaningful and so exhausting that when it was time for me to go up for promotion to full professorship, I quit my day job instead. About ten years into my life as a PhD, I gave up tenure and the ability to grow my retirement accou...</p></p><h2>The Binding: A Novel</h2><p><p><strong>NATIONAL BESTSELLER</strong></p><p><strong>A <em>NEW YORK TIMES </em>BOOK REVIEW EDITORS' CHOICE</strong></p><p><strong>Proclaimed as &#x201c;truly spellbinding,&#x201d; a &#x201c;great fable&#x201d; that &#x201c;functions as transporting romance&#x201d; by the <em>Guardian</em>, the runaway #1 international bestseller </strong></p><p>"A&nbsp;rich, gothic entertainment that explores what books have trapped inside them and reminds us of the power of storytelling.

Campbell, Jr., whom Asimov called &#x201c;the most powerful force in science fiction ever.&#x201d; Campbell, who has never been the subject of a biography until now, was both a visionary author&#x2014;he wrote the story that was later filmed as <em>The Thing</em>&#x2014;and the editor of the groundbreaking magazine best known as <em>Astounding Science Fiction</em>, in which he discovered countless legendary writers and published classic works ranging from the <em>I, Robot</em> series to <em>Dune</em>. Over a period of more than thirty years, from the rise of the pulps to the debut of <em>Star Trek</em>, he dominated the genre, and his three closest collaborators reached unimaginable heights. Asimov became the most prolific author in American history; Heinlein emerged as the leading science fiction writer of his generation with the novels <em>Starship Troopers</em> and <em>Stranger in a Strange Land</em>; and Hubbard achieved lasting fame&#x2014;and infamy&#x2014;as the founder of the Church of Scientology.&nbsp;</p><p>Drawing on unexplored archives, thousands of unpublished letters, and dozens of interviews, Alec Nevala-Lee offers a riveting portrait of this circle of authors, their work, and their tumultuous private lives.

Over a period of more than thirty years, from the rise of the pulps to the debut of <em>Star Trek,</em> Campbell dominated the genre, and his three closest collaborators reached unimaginable heights. Asimov became the most prolific author in American history; Heinlein emerged as the leading science fiction writer of his generation with the novels <em>Starship Troopers</em> and <em>Stranger in a Strange Land;</em> and Hubbard achieved lasting fame&#x2014;and infamy&#x2014;as the founder of the Church of Scientology. </p><p>Drawing on unexplored archives, thousands of unpublished letters, and dozens of interviews, Alec Nevala-Lee offers a riveting portrait of this circle of authors, their work, and their tumultuous private lives.

He demonstrates that beneath both language and myth there lies an unconscious "grammar" of experience, whose categories and canons are not those of logical thought. He shows that this prelogical "logic" is not merely an undeveloped state of rationality, but something basically different, and that this archaic mode of thought still has enormous power over even our most rigorous thought, in language, poetry and myth.<br>The author analyzes brilliantly such seemingly diverse (yet related) phenomena as the metaphysics of the Bhagavat Gita, the Melanesian concept of Mana, the Naturphilosophie of Schelling, modern poetry, Ancient Egyptian religion, and symbolic logic. He covers a vast range of material that is all too often neglected in studies of human thought.<br>These six essays are of great interest to the student of philosophy or the philosophy of science, the historian, or the anthropologist. They are also remarkably timely for students of literature, what with the enormous emphasis placed upon "myth" in modern literary speculation. This book is not superficial speculation by a dabbler, but a penetrating study by one of the most profound and sensitive philosophic minds of our time.</p><p></p></p><p></p><h2>A Journey into Gravity and Spacetime (Scientific American Library)</h2><p>Looks at the history of gravitational theories, discusses tides, planetary orbits, space-time, gravity waves, and black holes, and summarizes our current understanding of gravity</p><p>John Archibald Wheeler is Joseph Henry Professor Emeritus at Princeton University and was, until his retirement, Blumberg Professor of Physics and Director, Center for Theoretical Physics at the University of Texas at Austin.

As a small-town rabbi he counseled other people through pain and grief.

"I would write it out of my own need to put into words some of the most important things I have come to believe and know. And I would write it to help other people who might one day find themselves in a similar predicament. I am fundamentally a religious man who has been hurt by life, and I wanted to write a book that could be given to the person who has been hurt by life, and who knows in his heart that if there is justice in the world, he deserved better. . . . If you are such a person, if you want to believe in God's goodness and fairness but find it hard because of the things that have happened to you and to people you care about, and if this book helps you do that, then I will have succeeded in distilling some blessing out of Aaron's pain and tears."<br><br>Since its original publication in 1981, <i>When Bad Things Happen to Good People</i> has brought solace and hope to millions.

Murray's first appointment was to a remote and unattractive territory of nearly 50,000 square miles and 12,000 people. <p>In 1873, he helped to establish the Huguenot Seminary for girls.

First, the topic is introduced with an extensive discussion of the historical development of the arguments and objections to the arguments. Second, Bill leads the reader into the depths of the most contemporary discussion. He treats the leading versions of the arguments for Christianity as well as the best of the objections. He has taken great care to achieve a thoroughness that is rarely found in apologetics texts. Third, he explains, through many personal examples, how the arguments in the chapter can be appropriated in personal evangelism. Combining these three elements is enough to make this text unique.

Whether read as an existential tale, a parable, or a prophecy of the excesses of modern bureaucracy wedded to the madness of totalitarianism, Kafka's nightmare has resonated with chilling truth for generations of readers.<br><br>But until this edition, English-speaking readers have been able to read Kafka's masterpiece only in a translation of the 1925 German edition that was edited by Kafka's friend and literary executor, Max Brod, from an unfinished manuscript. Both Brod's edition and its 1937 translation by Willa and Edwin Muir have long been considered flawed.<br><br>This new edition is based upon the widely acclaimed work of an international team of experts who have restored the text, the sequence of chapters, and their division to create a version that is as close as possible to the way the author left it. <br><br>In his brilliant translation, Breon Mitchell masterfully reproduces the distinctive rhythms and wordplays of Kafka's prose, revealing a novel that is as full of energy and power as it was when it was first written.</p><p>The story of <i>The Trial</i>'s publication is almost as fascinating as the novel itself. Kafka intended his parable of alienation in a mysterious bureaucracy to be burned, along with the rest of his diaries and manuscripts, after his death in 1924. Yet his friend Max Brod pressed forward to prepare <i>The Trial</i> and the rest of his papers for publication. When the Nazis came to power, publication of Jewish writers such as Kafka was forbidden; Kafka's writings, many of which have distinctively Jewish themes, did not find a broad audience until after World War II. (Hannah Arendt once observed that although "during his lifetime he could not make a decent living, [Kafka] will now keep generations of intellectuals both gainfully employed and well-fed.") Among the current crop of Kafka heirs is Breon Mitchell, the translator of this edition of <i>The Trial</i>. Rather than tidying up Kafka's unconventional grammar and punctuation (as previous translators have done), Mitchell captures the loose, uneasy, even uncomfortable constructions of Kafka's original story. His translation technique is the only way to convey the comedy and confusion of this narrative, in which Josef K., "without having done anything truly wrong," is arrested, tried, convicted and executed--on a charge that is never disclosed to him. --<i>Michael Joseph Gross</i>Advance Praise for <b>The Trial</b><p>"Breon Mitchell's translation of the restored text is an accomplishment of the highest order--one that will honor Kafka, perhaps the most singular and compelling writer of our time, far into the twenty-first century." </p><p>--Walter Abish, author of <b>How German Is It</b></p><p>Praise for <b>The Castle</b> <br> translated by Mark Harman from the restored text</p><p>"The new Schocken edition of <b>The Castle</b> represents a major and long-awaited event in English- language publishing. It is a wonderful piece of news for all Kafka readers who, for more than half a century, have had to rely on flawed, superannuated editions. Mark Harman is to be commended for his success in capturing the fresh, fluid, almost breathless style of Kafka's original manuscript." <br>--Mark M.

The only thing he fears is missing the action. Soon, however, the vaunted &#x201c;war to end all wars&#x201d; seems like a war that will never end: whether mired in the trenches or going over the top, Jean finds himself caught in the midst of an unimaginable, unceasing slaughter. After he is wounded, he returns from the front to discover a world where no one knows or wants to know any of this. Both the public and the authorities go on talking about heroes&#x2014;and sending more men to their graves. But Jean refuses to keep silent. He will speak the forbidden word. He will tell them about fear. <br><br>John Berger has called <i>Fear</i> &#x201c;a book of the utmost urgency and relevance.&#x201d; A literary masterpiece, it is also an essential and unforgettable reckoning with the terrible war that gave birth to a century of war.</p><p><b>Gabriel Chevallier</b> (1895&#x2013;1969) was the son of a notary clerk and lived in Lyon for most of his life. He was called up at the start of World War I and wounded a year later. Returning to the front, he spent the remainder of the war as an infantryman, and was ultimately awarded the Croix de Guerre and named Chevalier de la L�gion d&#x2019;Honneur. He began writing <i>Fear</i> in 1925 but did not publish it until 1930, a year after his first novel, <i>Durand: voyageur de commerce</i>, was released. <i>Fear</i> was suppressed during World War II and not made available again until 1951, by which time Chevallier had earned international fame for his <i>Clochemerle </i>(1934), a comedy of provincial French manners of the Beaujolais region that sold several million copies. In all Chevallier would write twenty-one novels, including several more set in the fictional village of Clochemerle. <br><br><b>John Berger</b> is the author of numerous works of fiction and nonfiction, including <i>To the Wedding</i>, the <i>Into Their Labours</i> trilogy, <i>About Looking</i>, <i>Ways of Seeing</i>, and <i>G.</i>, for which he won the Booker Prize. His most recent book is <i>Understanding a Photograph</i>, a collection of his writings about photography, edited by Geoff Dyer. He lives in a small rural community in France.<br><br><b>Malcolm Imrie</b>&#x2019;s translations from the French include Guy Debord&#x2019;s <i>Comments on the Society of the Spectacle</i> and Jos� Pierre&#x2019;s <i>Investigating Sex: Surrealist Discussions 1928&#x2013;1932</i>. His translation of Gabriel Chevallier&#x2019;s <i>Fear </i>won the Scott Moncrieff Prize, the most prestigious award for a French-to-English translation."<i>Fear</i> hardly feels like an object from the lost-and-found, which is why it has preserved its capacity to gobsmack. Chevallier&#x2019;s protagonist, Jean Dartemont, a sardonic 19-year-old student from Paris shoved into a uniform and rushed to the trenches, narrates the war with a bracingly modern sensibility. He is confessional, self-deprecatory, and a little bit vulgar. There&#x2019;s a strong streak of Joseph Heller in his Erich Maria Remarque." &#x2014;Franklin Foer, <i>The New Republic</i><br><br>&#x201c;All the phases of this particularly horrid war, phases that we have become accustomed to from later writing, are recounted here in a remarkable voice...And, in this prizewinning translation by Malcolm Imrie, his writing still has a ferocious power...Chevallier&#x2019;s narrative remains radioactive with pure terror, frightening in a way later accounts don&#x2019;t quite manage. It&#x2019;s hard to believe, given the powerful, almost American casualness of his voice, that this is its first American appearance. His tone is so inveigling and so amiable as he inducts us like witnesses into that great European madness with which the past century began, decades before most who will read this translation were born. It&#x2019;s also hard to believe, once we&#x2019;re deeply engaged with the book, that Chevallier is dealing with events that are nearly a hundred years in the past, deploying prose that&#x2019;s almost as old. We are lucky his voice came through.&#x201d; &#x2014;Thomas Keneally,&nbsp;<i>The New York Times Book Review</i><br><br>"Chevallier&#x2019;s book...represents that rarest of war narratives&#x2014;one that is indispensable, nearly unprecedented, and painfully relevant....What makes Chevallier&#x2019;s book a masterpiece is the lucidity of the author&#x2019;s eyewitness account; its prose moves from practical concerns like picking lice to poetic reverie in the space of a paragraph, capturing the chaos of war and the stillness of the battlefield, revealing a terrible beauty." &#x2014;<i>Publishers Weekly</i> starred review<br><br>"A chronological burst of battle stories and vindictive reflections on the paradox of war, <i>Fear&nbsp;</i> is structurally similar to Ernst J�nger's <i>Storm of Steel</i>, while readers of C�line (a contemporary of Chevallier's) will catch whiffs of the sardonic misanthropy that runs through <i>Journey to the End of Night</i>. Dartemont deconstructs the notions of duty and heroism and draws their origins in fear and ignorance while letting us rifle through his blood-stained sketchbook with images from a war that grws ever more distant in our memories." &#x2014;<i>Booklist</i><br><br>"Its first-person narration by a young soldier who, like the author, was wounded in battle, hospitalized, returned to the front and remained an infantryman until the armistice reads like a cross between the darkest humor and the bleakest reportage....the themes of what [Chevallier] calls &#x201c;this anti-war book&#x201d; are timeless: the folly of nationalism, the foolish pomposity of military leaders, the arbitrariness of death, the madness of war." &#x2014;<i>Kirkus Reviews</i><br><br>&#x201c;Reading <i>Fear</i> feels like being led through the damnation panel of Bosch&#x2019;s <i>The Garden of Earthly Delights</i>, the front line &#x2018;blazing like some infernal factory where monstrous crucibles melted human flesh into a bloody lava.&#x2019; <i>Fear</i> remains a bravura work, fearless from start to finish, pitiless in its targets, passionate in its empathy.&#x201d; &#x2014;Neil Fitzgerald, <i>TLS</i><br><br>&#x201c;Gabriel Chevallier&#x2019;s autobiographical novel about serving in the bombed-out trenches of World War I still chills the blood. In indelible passages it describes the sensory degradation of war on the human body. Translated into English by Malcolm Imrie without a hint of stiltedness, Chevallier&#x2019;s long-neglected novel is one of the most effective indictments of war ever written.&#x201d; &#x2014;Tobias Grey, <i>The Wall Street Journal</i><br><br> &#x201c;If <i>Fear</i> has an English equivalent it is <i>The Middle Parts of Fortune</i> by Frederic Manning or, in German, <i>Storm of Steel</i> by Ernst J�nger, each of which give a view of the war from the perspective of lowly infantrymen, and both of whom, like Chevallier, remain stoutly immune to the old lie that <i>dulce et decorum est pro patria mori</i>.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>The Sunday Telegraph</i><br> <i>&nbsp;</i><br> &#x201c;Gabriel Chevallier, best known for his magnificent novel <i>Clochemerle</i>, has used his experiences during World War I to produce a work of great intensity, comparable to such great literary masterpieces of the period as Henri Barbusse&#x2019;s <i>Under Fire</i>.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>The Daily Mail</i><br><br>&nbsp; &#x201c;The most beautiful book ever written on the tragic events that blood-stained Europe for nearly five years.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>Le Libertaire</i><br><br>"Gabriel Chevallier&#x2019;s unsentimental 1930 novel<b>&nbsp;...&nbsp;</b>stands in angry denunciation of any presumed heroism in himself or his fellows...This is what has become of jaunty young fools who marched off to war dreaming of adventure and conquest, of tasting exotic foods and women.

For nearly all peoples of the world, the sword embodied the spirit of chivalry, symbolized justice and martyrdom and represented courage and freedom. In battle, it served universally as a deadly offensive weapon.<br>Drawing on a wealth of literary, archaeological, anthropological, linguistic, and other sources, the author traces the sword's origins, from its birth as a charred and sharpened stick, through its diverse stages of development, to its full growth in the early Roman Empire. Recounting man's long association with this weapon, the author describes in brilliant detail:<br>The ages of wood, bone and born<br>The appearance of stone swords and exotic weapons such as the boomerang<br>The ages of copper and alloys such as bronze and brass &#x2014; used in producing the long, narrow blades of rapiers<br>The Iron Age during which the Viking sword of carbonized iron took shape &#x2014; a weapon whose form would set the standard for the next thousand years.<br>Enhanced by nearly 300 excellent line drawings, the text provides an incredible wealth of detailed data about the sword and its variations: sabre, broadsword, cutlass, scimitar, rapier, foil, and a host of other arms, including dirks, daggers, throwing knives, flails, and much more.<br>Military and social historians, scholars and students of weaponry, as well as armchair adventurers will find this volume a fascinating, abundantly illustrated and highly readable account of this potent symbol of power.</p><p></p></p><p><strong>Richard Francis Burton</strong> was an explorer, translator, writer, soldier, spy, fencer, and diplomat.

Evidence of Directed Free-energy Technology on 9/11</h2><p>This book is a forensic analysis of what effectively is a crime scene. Ground Zero and the surrounding areas were photographed countless thousands of times, yet no one really assessed all of the phenomena found in these photographs. What is presented in this book is not a theory and it is not speculation. It is evidence. It is the body of empirical evidence that must be explained in order to determine what happened at Ground Zero.<br><br>Anyone declaring who did what or how they did it before they have determined what was done is merely promoting either speculation or propaganda. The popular chant, "9/11 was an inside job," is, scientifically speaking, no different from the chant that "19 bad guys with box cutters did it." Neither one is the result of a scientific investigation supported by evidence that would be admissible in court. Neither identifies what crime was committed or how it was committed.<br><br>The order of crime solving is to determine<br><br>1) WHAT happened, then<br><br>2) HOW it happened (e.g., what weapon), then<br><br>3) WHO did it. And only then can we address<br><br>4) WHY they did it (i.e. motive).<br><br>Let us remember what is required to (legally) convict someone of a crime. You cannot convict someone of a crime based on belief. You cannot convict someone of a crime if you don't even know what crime to charge them with. If you accuse someone of murder using a gun, you'd better be sure the body has a bullet hole in it. Yet, before noon on 9/11/01, we were told who did it, how they did it, and why they did it (they hate us for our freedoms); before any investigation had been conducted to determine what had even been done.<br><br>Many people have speculated as to who committed the crimes of 9/11 and/or how they did so. But without addressing what happened, speculation of this kind is nothing more than conspiracy theory. My research is not speculation. It is a forensic investigation of what happened to the WTC complex on 9/11.</p><p></p><h2>English Grammar in Use: A Self-Study Reference and Practice Book for Intermediate Learners of English - with Answers</h2><p>English Grammar in Use with Answers, authored by Raymond Murphy, is the first choice for intermediate (B1-B2) learners and covers all the grammar required at this level.

By the time he'd sold his third, Vonnegut quit GE to join the likes of Hemingway, Fitzgerald, and Faulkner to write short stories at fifteen-hundred dollars a piece, before his first novel, <i>Player Piano</i>, launched his remarkable career as a countercultural novelist.Return of the Old Rambler, doing a replay on his 1981 autobiographical collage Palm Sunday, this time pasting together a memoir from speeches, forewords, articles, and so on written since 1981. Norman Mailer invented this format with Advertisements for Myself (1959) and no one, including Mailer, has done it as well since. Vonnegut adds plenty of humor to his new model but not much sinew. There's something truly self-defeating about parenthetical asides that leave each page of copy slack with interruptions. He includes vague forewords to Franklin Library editions of his more recent novels; writes of his brushes with Salman Rushdie (who, despite a friendship with Vonnegut, shot down one of his novels, with Vonnegut seriously thinking of adding another team to the hit list on Rushdie); comments on the firebombing of Dresden; recalls dead friends who appeared in Slaughterhouse-Five and dead fellow novelists Nelson Algren, Donald Barthelme, Hemingway, James Jones, Irwin Shaw, and others; and discusses his own incompetence as a speech-writer, his dislike of or inability to read his own works, and a suicide attempt that was foiled by a stomach pump. Vonnegut pictures himself as a depressive, though his less-than-faint hope for humanity is not as corroded as Mark Twain's during his later years. Vonnegut's most well-developed theme is in the title, as he weighs fates worse than death, including crucifixion (enslavement by the Reverend Jim Jones of the Guyana Kool-Aid horror doesn't measure up). His most memorable moments are about his first wife Jane and her death from cancer; his architect father, who never got a chance to show his stuff; and his deep feelings for fellow Dresden POW Bernard V. O'Hare. Vonnegut writes best about people, while his think pieces are sliced up with asides or dry-gulched by his alter ego. Patchy. -- <i>Copyright �1991, Kirkus Associates, LP.

In this, the first major book on the subject in fifty years, Stephen Jay Gould documents the history of the idea of recapitulation from its first appearance among the pre-Socratics to its fall in the early twentieth century.</p><p>Mr. Gould explores recapitulation as an idea that intrigued politicians and theologians as well as scientists. He shows that Haeckel&#x2019;s hypothesis&#x2015;that human fetuses with gill slits are, literally, tiny fish, exact replicas of their water-breathing ancestors&#x2015;had an influence that extended beyond biology into education, criminology, psychoanalysis (Freud and Jung were devout recapitulationists), and racism. The theory of recapitulation, Gould argues, finally collapsed not from the weight of contrary data, but because the rise of Mendelian genetics rendered it untenable.</p><p>Turning to modern concepts, Gould demonstrates that, even though the whole subject of parallels between ontogeny and phylogeny fell into disrepute, it is still one of the great themes of evolutionary biology. Heterochrony&#x2015;changes in developmental timing, producing parallels between ontogeny and phylogeny&#x2015;is shown to be crucial to an understanding of gene regulation, the key to any rapprochement between molecular and evolutionary biology. Gould argues that the primary evolutionary value of heterochrony may lie in immediate ecological advantages for slow or rapid maturation, rather than in long-term changes of form, as all previous theories proclaimed.</p><p>Neoteny&#x2015;the opposite of recapitulation&#x2015;is shown to be the most important determinant of human evolution. We have evolved by retaining the juvenile characters of our ancestors and have achieved both behavioral flexibility and our characteristic morphology thereby (large brains by prolonged retention of rapid fetal growth rates, for example).</p><p>Gould concludes that &#x201c;there may be nothing new under the sun, but permutation of the old within complex systems can do wonders. As biologists, we deal directly with the kind of material complexity that confers an unbounded potential upon simple, continuous changes in underlying processes. This is the chief joy of our science.&#x201d;</p></p><p>In this, the first major book on the subject in fifty years, Stephen Jay Gould documents the history of the idea of recapitulation from its appearance among the pre-Socratics to its demise in the early twentieth century.Stephen Jay Gould was Alexander Agassiz Professor of Zoology at Harvard University and Vincent Astor Visiting Professor of Biology at New York University.

Taken together, this is pure nectar to those who aim for consistently superior stock market performance." -Barron's<br> <br> "The Education of a Speculator offers plenty of insights into the way markets work, but the epiphanies are what a reader might expect from Lao-tzu rather than, say, Graham and Dodd." -Worth magazine<br> <br> "The Education of a Speculator is the first meaningful book on speculating. Successful speculating is as fine an art as chess, checkers, fishing, poker, tennis, painting, and music. Niederhoffer brings forth the best from each of these fields and shows the investor how their principles can enrich one's life and net worth." -Martin Edelston, President, Boardroom Inc., publishers of Boardroom Classics and Bottom Line/Personal<br> <br> "With an original mind and an eclectic approach, Victor Niederhoffer takes the reader from Brighton Beach to Wall Street, visiting all stops of interest along the way. What emerges is a book full of insights, useful to the professional and layman alike." -George Soros, Principal Investment Advisor, The Quantum Fund</p><p>What you typically hear about Victor Niederhoffer is that he trades for "the great Soros," that he doesn't wear shoes in his office, that the only newspaper he reads is the National Enquirer, and that a picture of the Titanic hangs in his office. <p> That's all true. But it's the logic behind the eccentricities that is the real story. The Education of a Speculator is a sojourn inside the one-of-a-kind mind of Victor Niederhoffer, a trader in commodities and a keen observer of life. He has trained himself to look at the world in a singular fashion: where the guy on the street sees opportunity, Niederhoffer has scoped out all the downsides and done the contrarian thinking necessary to turn a profit. Niederhoffer draws material from disciplines as varied as biology, music, cards, and sports. His book, written with humor and verve, offers readers a chance to see the world through his lenses. The result is a genuinely new perspective on life (unless you too happened to grow up a speculator). This is a terrific, rewarding book.</p>A fascinating story that successfully entwines the complete life and education of a top commodity trader with his successes and failures in the markets. Provides readers with valuable trading skills.</p><h2>Finally Focused: The Breakthrough Natural Treatment Plan for ADHD That Restores Attention, Minimizes Hyperactivity, and Helps Eliminate Drug Side Effects</h2><p>DISCOVER THE ADHD SOLUTION FOR YOUR CHILD<br><br>Dr. James Greenblatt has seen thousands of children and adults struggling with the symptoms of ADHD &#x2013; hyperactivity, inattentiveness, impulsiveness, and often irritability and combativeness. Rather than simply prescribing medication for their ADHD symptoms, he tailors remedies to his patients&#x2019; individual needs, detecting and treating the underlying causes of the disorder. <br><br><i>Finally Focused</i> provides proven natural and medical methods to easily treat problems such as nutritional deficiencies or excesses, dysbiosis (a microbial imbalance inside the body), sleeping difficulties, and food allergies, all of which surprisingly can cause or worsen the symptoms of ADHD. Using Dr. Greenblatt&#x2019;s effective Plus-Minus Healing Plan, parents will first understand the reasons behind their child's symptoms, and then be able to eliminate them by addressing the child&#x2019;s unique pattern of biological weakness. Adults with ADHD can do the same for themselves. And if conventional medication is still necessary, this integrative approach will minimize or even eliminate troublesome side effects. Using Dr. Greenblatt&#x2019;s expert advice, millions of children and adults with ADHD finally will get the help they need to achieve true wellness.</p><p><p><b>JAMES GREENBLATT, MD</b>, is board-certified in both child and adult psychiatry, and has treated thousands of children and adults with ADHD over the past 30 years, using a unique, science-based approach that combines both natural and medical therapeutics.

Twelve-year-old Noah and his parents were in my office for help with the same stressful symptoms that have brought thousands of frustrated parents and unhappy children to my clinic: Noah was impulsive, hyperactive, and inattentive, and his life at home and at school was in shambles.</p><p>His parents told me that as a young child, Noah was often fidgety and couldn&#x2019;t sit still for more than a few minutes. Noah himself told me the only time he felt happy these days was when he was &#x201c;wandering around&#x201d; outside.&nbsp;</p><p>Noah, said his parents, had done well in school until he was in the second grade, when he started to interrupt his teachers constantly. Sometimes the school called, asking that Noah be taken home.</p><p>Noah struggled socially, too. He found it hard to make friends. He couldn&#x2019;t sit down and play a board game without becoming restless when the other children took their turns. Sometimes when he lost the game he threw the board at a friend. Playdates became increasingly rare.</p><p>When Noah was eight, his parents took him to a doctor, hoping an ADHD medication might provide relief. The doctor agreed to the treatment and prescribed Ritalin.</p><p>But the drug made things worse. Noah became extremely emotional. He cried easily. His appetite disappeared.</p><p>He was taken off Ritalin and put on Adderall.</p><p>He stopped feeling sad all the time, but instead started feeling agitated and anxious. After a month on the drug, Noah developed a facial tic.</p><p>Adderall was halted--and Noah&#x2019;s problems continued, year after year.</p><p>When Noah became my patient, he was hyperactive, found it hard to focus, and--because he couldn&#x2019;t control his impulsiveness--didn&#x2019;t have any friends.</p><p>Noah&#x2019;s story and symptoms made my first choice of treatment obvious: Twice daily, Noah was to take 200 milligrams (mg) of brain-balancing, body-calming magnesium.</p><p>One month after he started magnesium, I also restarted Noah on a low dose of Vyvanse (20 mg), a stimulant medication.</p><p>And this integrative approach--treating Noah with a key nutrient and a dose-regulated stimulant--produced tremendous results.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m doing awesome,&#x201d; Noah enthusiastically said to me when I saw him and his parents two months later.</p><p>He told me that he could sit still and participate in class. And that he was making some friends.</p><p>&#x201c;I used to feel like my brain was a dull knife,&#x201d; Noah said, sitting between his smiling parents. &#x201c;It didn&#x2019;t work right. It couldn&#x2019;t cut through anything. But now it&#x2019;s like a sharp knife--it works great.&#x201d;</p><p>Why Magnesium Works</p><p>How can one nutrient make such a big difference in the symptoms of an ADHD child--in her life, and in the lives of her parents, teachers, and friends? There are many answers to that question.</p><p>The first fact to know: Magnesium plays a role in more than three hundred enzyme systems, biochemical spark plugs that ignite cellular activity. For example, if magnesium is minimal, so is ATP (adenosine triphosphate), the fundamental fuel that powers every cell. Blood sugar isn&#x2019;t correctly regulated, and the immune system is weakened. Most important for your ADHD child, the brain is compromised.</p><p>Too little magnesium weakens the brain because the mineral plays a key role in the formation of neurotransmitters, chemicals that help send messages between brain cells. If magnesium levels are suboptimal, your child is likely to have imbalanced levels of two neurotransmitters: attention-regulating dopamine, and mood-regulating serotonin. Low magnesium can also undercut the functioning of glutamate receptors, areas on brain cells that assist the movement of neurotransmitters.</p><p>The end result of a magnesium-deprived brain? In children and adolescents, it&#x2019;s often the symptoms of ADHD. Research links low magnesium levels in children with:</p><p>�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Poor concentration</p><p>�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Irritability and anxiety</p><p>�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Depression and apathy</p><p>�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mood swings</p><p>�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fatigue</p><p>�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sleeping problems, like insomnia</p><p>Okay, low levels of magnesium are bad for your ADHD child. But why are levels low? Shockingly, magnesium deficiency could be a side effect of the ADHD drug your child is taking!</p><p>Yes, stimulant drugs like Ritalin and Adderall that are intended to help ADHD might actually be complicating the problem--because they leach magnesium from the body. In my experience, a deficit of nerve-nourishing magnesium is often behind ADHD drug side effects like irritability, agitation, anxiety, insomnia, facial tics, and nail-biting. Add supplemental magnesium to the mix, and all those symptoms are likely to disappear. That&#x2019;s what happened with Noah. He couldn&#x2019;t take an ADHD drug without side effects. But when he took the drug and magnesium, he was fine. (Or as Noah said, he was awesome.)</p><p>Noah is hardly alone. Relieving the side effects of ADHD with magnesium has generated more &#x201c;Thank yous&#x201d; from parents and their children than any other ADHD treatment I use.</p><p>Many Children Are Low in Magnesium</p><p>But even if your ADHD child isn&#x2019;t taking an ADHD medication, odds are 50-50 that he has a low level of magnesium. Research shows that half of Americans (including children) get less than the government&#x2019;s Recommended Daily Allowance (RDA) for magnesium1--probably because we Americans eat so many processed foods, most of which are stripped of magnesium during processing.</p><p>In the first decade of the twentieth century, when Americans ate more whole foods, people ingested 475 to 500 mg of magnesium daily. That level of intake has declined decade by decade, until now we consume 175 to 225 mg daily.</p><p>The nonstop pace of modern life also puts us under nonstop stress, which drains the body of magnesium.</p><p>How many ADHD children are actually deficient in magnesium? Nearly all of them!</p><p>In one study, doctors measured the magnesium levels of 114 children with ADHD and found that an astounding 110 of the children--96%--were deficient in magnesium.2 My clinical experience is similar, with rates at 90%.</p><p>Because magnesium deficiency is so common among children with ADHD, and because supplementing with magnesium can make such a huge difference in a child&#x2019;s behavior (on or off medication), I recommend every patient with ADHD take a supplement of the mineral. The appropriateness of my approach to magnesium supplementation is confirmed by many scientific studies on magnesium and ADHD.</p><p>Scientific Support for . . . The Power of Magnesium to Heal the Symptoms of ADHD</p><p>I&#x2019;d like to tell you about several studies that show the importance of magnesium in ADHD . . .</p><p>Less hyperactivity, inattention, impulsivity, and opposition--with 200 mg of magnesium a day. In the most recent study, Egyptian scientists measured magnesium levels in children with ADHD, finding deficiency in 72%.3 They also found that those with the lowest magnesium levels had the most hyperactivity and the lowest IQs.</p><p>They divided the children into two groups: half took 200 mg of magnesium daily and half took a placebo. After eight weeks, the children taking magnesium had &#x201c;significant improvements&#x201d; compared to the placebo takers. Specifically:</p><p>�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hyperactivity was 90% less</p><p>�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; inattention was 66% less&nbsp;</p><p>�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; oppositional behavior was 33% less</p><p>�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; executive function was 40% better (Executive function includes keeping track of time, finishing work on time, problem-solving, and using memory for everyday tasks.)</p><p>Add magnesium, symptoms decrease. Subtract magnesium, symptoms return. In a study of 40 children with ADHD, French scientists supplemented their diets with magnesium and vitamin B6, a &#x201c;cofactor&#x201d; that helps cells use magnesium.4</p><p>As levels of magnesium went up over two months, symptoms went down. The children were less hyperactive, aggressive, and irritable; had more focus at school; and slept better.</p><p>But when the children stopped taking the two nutrients, their magnesium levels started to decrease--and so did the behavioral improvements created by the mineral. &#x201c;Clinical symptoms of ADHD appeared in a few weeks, together with a decrease&#x201d; in levels of magnesium, reported the scientists in Magnesium Research.</p><p>The scientists concluded that magnesium supplementation &#x201c;could be required in children with ADHD.&#x201d; Not just recommended, but required.</p><p>Better brain waves, better behavior. In a similar study, published in the journal Neuroscience and Behavioral Physiology, doctors supplemented the diets of ADHD children with magnesium and B6--with very positive results.5 The children had less hyperactivity, better attentiveness, and less anxiety.</p><p>Looking at the children&#x2019;s behaviors at school, the researchers noted the children had &#x201c;improvement in task performance,&#x201d; &#x201c;decreases in the proportion of errors,&#x201d; and &#x201c;increases in the rate of work.&#x201d;</p><p>The supplemented ADHD children also had a complete disappearance of two types of activities sometimes seen in ADHD: perseveration (rote, repetitive behaviors and movements); and stereotypy (senseless acts or words).</p><p>The doctors also took EEG (electroencephalographic) measurements before and after the supplementation with magnesium and B6. The postsupplement brain waves were far more normal: fewer spikes and flurries of random activity; and higher frequencies, a type of brain wave linked to better focus.</p><p>More happiness, less loneliness, better sleep. In several other studies, the diets of children with ADHD were supplemented with magnesium and other brain-supporting nutrients, like omega-3 fatty acids (EPA and DHA) and zinc--an approach I use in my own practice, where children typically take more than one supplement.</p><p>In one such study, published in the medical journal Lipids in Health and Disease, German researchers gave hundreds of children with ADHD a daily supplement containing magnesium, zinc, omega-3 fatty acids (EPA and DHA), and an omega-6 fatty acid (GLA).6</p><p>After three months, the researchers saw a &#x201c;clear reduction&#x201d; in symptoms of ADHD, including hyperactivity, inattention, and impulsivity. They also saw fewer emotional problems, less isolation (among &#x201c;children who were described as loners&#x201d;), and fewer problems with sleeping.</p><p>&#x201c;No Ritalin was needed.&#x201d; Writing in the Journal of the American College of Nutrition, a team of French researchers reported the case history of L., a seven-year-old boy, and one of 52 ADHD children they had treated with magnesium and vitamin B6.7</p><p>&#x201c;L. developed a breath-holding spell in his first year, he was hyperexcitable at 3 years, and reports sleep disturbances at 5 years,&#x201d; they wrote. At the end of nursery school, when L. was six years old, &#x201c;the clinical evaluation indicated aggressivity, anxiety . . . inattention and no self-control.&#x201d;</p><p>At that time, the doctors discovered his magnesium levels were low and began supplementing with the mineral and vitamin B6.</p><p>Six months later, L. had normal magnesium levels. He also had normal sleep, no aggressivity, and was &#x201c;more tender, more concentrated, more quiet.&#x201d;</p><p>Magnesium is effective. The last study I&#x2019;d like to tell you about is a &#x201c;meta-analysis&#x201d;--a study that analyzes the results of several other studies. In this meta-analysis, researchers looked at six other studies on magnesium and ADHD. Their conclusion: magnesium shows &#x201c;promise&#x201d; in the effective treatment of ADHD.8</p><p>Bottom line. In my practice, magnesium is more than a promise. It is a much-needed and effective treatment for the symptoms of ADHD, and a way to eliminate side effects from ADHD medications.</p><p>How to Supplement with Magnesium</p><p>Supplementing your child&#x2019;s diet with magnesium is fairly straightforward.</p><p>Should my child be tested for a magnesium deficiency? The likely answer is no. Most magnesium tests are inaccurate. They measure blood levels--when 99% of the mineral is found in cells and bones. Such a test is likely to show a child with ADHD has a &#x201c;normal&#x201d; level of magnesium--when, in fact, he&#x2019;s deficient. A hair test for minerals is a better indicator of a magnesium deficiency, and I routinely order this test to determine levels of lithium and copper--but even without the results, I know in advance that every child with ADHD will benefit from supplemental magnesium.</p><p>Should my ADHD child take magnesium? Yes, if your child has been diagnosed with ADHD. It&#x2019;s that simple.</p><p>Other indications that make the necessity for taking magnesium even more compelling:</p><p>�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your ADHD child is on a stimulant medication--which drains the body of magnesium.</p><p>�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your ADHD child has side effects from a stimulant medication--which magnesium can often resolve.</p><p>�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your ADHD child sleeps poorly, is anxious, and/or is prone to constipation--all telltale signs of a magnesium deficiency.</p><p>How much magnesium is best? Dosages vary by age. Typically, I recommend magnesium glycinate, using the powdered product Natural Calm, from Natural Vitality, which contains 325 to 350 mg of magnesium per serving dose. (The product is widely available online, and in many pharmacies, like Walmart and CVS.) I like it because the child can take magnesium in a tasty drink, rather than swallowing a pill.</p><p>Here are the dosage guidelines I follow in my practice:</p><p>13 and older: 200 mg, twice daily.</p><p>10 to 12: 100 mg, twice daily.</p><p>6 to 9: 50 mg, twice daily.</p><p>Under 6: I recommend microdoses of 10 mg daily, in liquid form, using Liquid Ionic Magnesium, from New Beginnings. (Please see the Appendix at the end of the book for ordering information.)</p><p>What form of magnesium is best? There are many different forms of magnesium, like magnesium glycinate, magnesium oxide, magnesium citrate, and magnesium gluconate. In my clinical experience, all of them are equally effective, with one exception: magnesium oxide, which is poorly absorbed.</p><p>Lately, a few health experts have been touting magnesium L-threonate as the best form of magnesium for the brain. That&#x2019;s because several studies (all but one of them on laboratory animals) show brain-based benefits, like healthier brain cells and protection against age-related mental decline. There&#x2019;s nothing wrong with magnesium L-threonate but it is more expensive than other forms.</p><p>What brand is best? Magnesium supplements are generally reliable--what the label says, the product delivers. When consumerlab.com--a supplement-testing company--investigated twenty-six products, it found only one of them didn&#x2019;t contain the amount of magnesium on the label. The &#x201c;Not Approved&#x201d; magnesium product was from the company New Capstone.</p><p>In my clinical practice I use a magnesium supplement from Natural Calm, a kid-friendly magnesium powder by the company Natural Vitality (not tested). I also use magnesium supplements from Pure Encapsulation (&#x201c;Approved&#x201d; by consumerlab.com), and from New Beginnings (not tested).</p><p>1. Rosanoff A, et al.

Five years later, one is earning a good salary at a prestigious accounting firm. With no loans to repay, she lives in a fashionable apartment with her fianc�. The other woman, saddled with burdensome debt and a low GPA, is still struggling to finish her degree in tourism. In an era of skyrocketing tuition and mounting concern over whether college is "worth it," <i>Paying for the Party</i> is an indispensable contribution to the dialogue assessing the state of American higher education. A powerful expos� of unmet obligations and misplaced priorities, it explains in vivid detail why so many leave college with so little to show for it.</p><p>Drawing on findings from a five-year interview study, Elizabeth Armstrong and Laura Hamilton bring us to the campus of "MU," a flagship Midwestern public university, where we follow a group of women drawn into a culture of status seeking and sororities. Mapping different pathways available to MU students, the authors demonstrate that the most well-resourced and seductive route is a "party pathway" anchored in the Greek system and facilitated by the administration. This pathway exerts influence over the academic and social experiences of all students, and while it benefits the affluent and well-connected, Armstrong and Hamilton make clear how it seriously disadvantages the majority.</p><p>Eye-opening and provocative, <i>Paying for the Party</i> reveals how outcomes can differ so dramatically for those whom universities enroll.</p></p><p><p>Elizabeth A. Armstrong is Professor of Sociology and Organizational Studies at the University of Michigan.</p><p>Laura T. Hamilton is Associate Professor of Sociology at the University of California, Merced.</p>&#x201c;Instead of being a great equalizer, <i>Paying for the Party</i> argues, the American way of college rewards those who come not just academically but socially prepared, while treating working-class students more cruelly, and often leaving them adrift.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Ross Douthat</b><b>, </b><b><i>New York Times</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;A striking new book...

Such parties allow daughters of the affluent to flaunt their social advantages while exposing the vulnerabilities of female students from less-privileged backgrounds. Unfortunately, the authors find such parties well established in the &#x2018;party pathway&#x2019; through the university. Focusing on female students, the authors find from campus observations and interviews ample evidence that four years on the party pathway will open doors of power for the elite while stranding the wannabes with mountains of student-loan debt and few employment options for paying off that debt... A provocative expos� of socially polarizing trends in higher education&#x2015;certain to spark debate.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Bryce Christensen</b><b>, </b><b><i>Booklist</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Armstrong and Hamilton report the results of their five-year study of a group of young women who began in the same freshman dorm but ended up in very different situations. The constraints of social and economic class remained formidable, and moving into the professional class seemed virtually impossible, especially for those women who followed what the authors call &#x2018;the party pathway.&#x2019; Women from more privileged backgrounds survived their partying through school due to their more substantial support systems at home. We also see how difficult the college adjustment was for less talented students and for women from modest backgrounds and small towns... The conclusions are sobering, if not depressing. Armstrong and Hamilton assail the university itself for a number of failures, including an ineffectual system of student advising; a plethora of meaningless majors and courses designed to attract full-paying students, many of whom have no intention of actually pursuing such a career; and its continuing support for the fraternity/sorority system, which the authors contend undermines the very academic mission of the university. Athletics take some major blame, as well. The authors also discovered that some of the women who transferred to regional campuses performed better and were happier.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b><i>Kirkus Reviews</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Armstrong and Hamilton pepper the book with student interviews, and ultimately suggest substantial changes to university structure for creating an egalitarian, merit-based environment.

He&#x2019;s got a job&#x2014;transcribing old books and presenting them as the words of the great new leader, Fyodor Kuzmich, Glorybe&#x2014;and though he doesn&#x2019;t enjoy the privileged status of a Murza, at least he&#x2019;s not a serf or a half-human four-legged Degenerator harnessed to a troika. He has a house, too, with enough mice to cook up a tasty meal, and he&#x2019;s happily free of mutations: no extra fingers, no gills, no cockscombs sprouting from his eyelids. And he&#x2019;s managed&#x2014;at least so far&#x2014;to steer clear of the ever-vigilant Saniturions, who track down anyone who manifests the slightest sign of Freethinking, and the legendary screeching Slynx that waits in the wilderness beyond. &nbsp;<br><br> Tatyana Tolstaya&#x2019;s <i>The Slynx</i> reimagines dystopian fantasy as a wild, horripilating amusement park ride. Poised between Nabokov&#x2019;s <i>Pale Fire</i> and Burgess&#x2019;s <i>A Clockwork Orange</i>, <i>The Slynx</i> is a brilliantly inventive and shimmeringly ambiguous work of art: an account of a degraded world that is full of echoes of the sublime literature of Russia&#x2019;s past; a grinning portrait of human inhumanity; a tribute to art in both its sovereignty and its helplessness; a vision of the past as the future in which the future is now.</p><p><p>Born in Leningrad, <b>Tatyana Tolstaya</b> comes from an old Russian family that includes the writers Leo and Alexei Tolstoy. She studied at Leningrad State University and then moved to Moscow, where she continues to live. She is also the author of <i>Pushkin&#x2019;s Children: Writings on Russia and Russians</i>.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b>Jamey Gambrell</b> is a writer on Russian art and culture. Her translations include&nbsp; Marina Tsvetaeva's <i>Earthly Signs: Moscow Diaries 1917&#x2014;1922 </i>and Vladimir Sorokin's&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Ice</i>, published by NYRB Classics on December 2006.</p>1 R AZ Benedikt pulled on his felt boots, stomped his feet to get the fit right, checked the damper on the stove, brushed the bread crumbs onto the floor for the mice wedged a rag in the window to keep out the cold, stepped out the door, and breathed the pure, frosty air in through his nostrils. Ah, what a day! The night&#x2019;s storm had passed, the snow gleamed all white and fancy, the sky was turning blue, and the high elfir trees stood still. Black rabbits flitted from treetop to treetop. Benedikt stood squinting, his reddish beard tilted upward, watching the rabbits. If only he could down a couple for a new cap. But he didn&#x2019;t have a stone.<br> It would be nice to have the meat, too. Mice, mice, and more mice he was fed up with them.<br> Give black rabbit meat a good soaking, bring it to boil seven times, set it in the sun for a week or two, then steam it in the oven and it won&#x2019;t kill you.<br> That is, if you catch a female. Because the male, boiled or not, it doesn&#x2019;t matter. People didn&#x2019;t used to know this, they were hungry and ate the males too. But now they know: if you eat the males you&#x2019;ll be stuck with a wheezing and a gurgling in your chest the rest of your life. Your legs will wither. Thick black hairs will grow like crazy out of your ears and you&#x2019;ll stink to high heaven.<br> Benedikt sighed: time for work. He wrapped his coat around him, set a wood beam across the door of the izba, and even shoved a stick behind it. There wasn&#x2019;t anything to steal, but he was used to doing things that way. Mother, may she rest in peace, always did it that way. In the Oldener Days, before the Blast, she told him, everyone locked their doors. The neighbors learned this from Mother and it caught on. Now the whole settlement locked their doors with sticks. It might be Freethinking.<br> His hometown, Fyodor-Kuzmichsk, spread out over seven hills. Benedikt walked along listening to the squeak of fresh snow, enjoying the February sun, admiring the familiar streets. Here and there black izbas stood in rows behind high pike fences and wood gates; stone pots or wood jugs were set to dry on the pikes. The taller terems had bigger jugs, and some people would even stick a whole barrel up there on the spike, right in your face as if to say: Look how rich I am, Golubchiks! People like that don&#x2019;t trudge to work on their own two feet, they ride on sleighs, flashing their whips, and they&#x2019;ve got a Degenerator hitched up. The poor thing runs, all pale, in a lather, its tongue hanging out, its felt boots thudding. It races to the Work Izba and stops stock-still on all four legs, but its fuzzy sides keep going huffa, puffa, huffa, puffa.<br> And it rolls its eyes, rolls &#x2019;em up and down and sideways. And bares its teeth. And looks around . . .<br> To hell with them, those Degenerators, better to keep your distance. They&#x2019;re strange ones, and you can&#x2019;t figure out if they&#x2019;re people or not. Their faces look human, but their bodies are all furry and they run on all fours. With a felt boot on each leg. It&#x2019;s said they lived before the Blast, Degenerators. Could be.<br> It&#x2019;s nippy out now, steam comes out of his mouth, and his beard&#x2019;s frozen up. Still what bliss! The izbas are sturdy and black, there are high white snowdrifts leaning against the fences, and a little path has been beaten to each gate. The hills run smooth all the way up and back down, white, wavy; sleighs slide along the snowy slopes, and beyond the sleighs are blue shadows, and the snow crunches in colors, and beyond the hills the sun rises, splashing rainbows on the dark blue sky. When you squint, the rays of the sun turn into circles; when you stomp your boots in the fluffy snow it sparks, like when ripe firelings flicker.<br> Benedikt thought a moment about firelings, remembered his mother, and sighed: she passed away on account of those firelings, poor thing. They turned out to be fake.<br> The town of Fyodor-Kuzmichsk spreads out over seven hills. Around the town are boundless fields, unknown lands. To the north are deep forests, full of storm-felled trees, the limbs so twisted you can&#x2019;t get through, prickly bushes catch at your britches, branches pull your cap off your head. Old people say the Slynx lives in those forests. The Slynx sits on dark branches and howls a wild, sad howl eeeeennxx, eeeeennxx, eeenx- aleeeeeennnxx but no one ever sees it. If you wander into the forest it jumps on your neck from behind: hop! It grabs your spine in its teeth crunch and picks out the big vein with its claw and breaks it. All the reason runs right out of you. If you come back, you&#x2019;re never the same again, your eyes are different, and you don&#x2019;t ever know where you&#x2019;re headed, like when people walk in their sleep under the moon, their arms outstretchhed, their fingers fluttering: they&#x2019;re asleep, but they&#x2019;re standing on their own two feet. People will find you and take you inside, and someeeeetimes, for fun, they&#x2019;ll set an empty plate in front of you, stick a spoon in your hand, and say Eat.&#x201d; And you sit there like you&#x2019;re eating from an empty plate, you scrape and scrape and put the spoon in your mouth and chew, and then you make to wipe your dish with a piece of bread, but there&#x2019;s no bread in your hand. Your kinfolk are rolling on the floor with laughter. You can&#x2019;t do for yourself, not even take a leak, someone has to show you each time. If your missus or mother feels sorry for you, she takes you to the outhouse, but if there&#x2019;s no one to watch after you, you&#x2019;re a goner, your bladder will burst, and you&#x2019;ll just die.<br> That&#x2019;s what the Slynx does.<br> You can&#x2019;t go west either. There&#x2019;s a sort of road that way invisible, like a little path. You walk and walk, then the town is hidden from your eyes, a sweet breeze blows from the fields, everything&#x2019;s fine and good, and then all of a sudden, they say, you just stop. And you stand there. And you think: Where was I going anyway? What do I need there? What&#x2019;s there to see? It&#x2019;s not like it&#x2019;s better out there. And you feel so sorry for yourself. You think: Maybe the missus is crying back at the izba, searching the horizon, holding her hand over her eyes; the chickens are running around the yard, they miss you too; the izba stove is hot, the mice are having a field day, the bed is soft . . . And it&#x2019;s like a worrum got at your heart, and he&#x2019;s gnawing a hole in it . . . You turn back. Sometimes you run. And as soon as you can see your own pots on your fence, tears burst from your eyes. It&#x2019;s really true, they splash a whole mile. No lie!<br> You can&#x2019;t go south. The Chechens live there. First it&#x2019;s all steppe, steppe, and more steppe your eyes could fall out from staring. Then beyond the steppe the Chechens. In the middle of the town there&#x2019;s a watchtower with four windows, and guards keep watch out of all of them. They&#x2019;re on the lookout for Chechens. They don&#x2019;t really look all the time, of course, as much as they smoke swamp rusht and play straws. One person grabs four straws in his fist three long ones, one short. Whoever picks the short one gets a whack on the forehead. But sometimes they look out the window. If they spot a Chechen, they&#x2019;re supposed to cry Chechens, Chechens!&#x201d; and then people from all the settlements run out and start beating pots with sticks, to scare the Chechens. And the Chechens skedaddle. Once, two people approached the town from the south, an old man and an old woman. We banged on our pots, stomped and hollered up a storm, but the Chechens didn&#x2019;t care, they just kept on coming and looking around. We well, the boldest of us went out to meet them with tongs, spindles, whatever there was. To see who they were and why they came.<br> We&#x2019;re from the south, Golubchiks,&#x201d; they said. We&#x2019;ve been walking for two weeks, we&#x2019;ve walked our feet off. We came to trade rawhide strips. Maybe you have some goods?&#x201d; What goods could we have? We eat mice. Mice Are Our Mainstay,&#x201d; that&#x2019;s what Fyodor Kuzmich, Glorybe, teaches. But our people are softhearted, they gathered what there was in the izbas and traded for the rawhide and let them go their way. Later there was a lot of talk about them. Everyone jabbered about what they were like, the stories they told, how come they showed up.<br> Well, they looked just like us: the old man was gray-headed and wore reed shoes, the old woman wore a scarf, her eyes were blue, and she had horns. Their stories were long and sad. Benedikt was little and didn&#x2019;t have any sense at all then, but he was all ears.<br> They said that in the south there&#x2019;s an azure sea, and in that sea there&#x2019;s an island, and on that island there&#x2019;s a tower, and in that tower there&#x2019;s a golden stove bed. On that bed there&#x2019;s a girl with long hair one hair is gold, the next is silver, one is gold, and the next is silver. She lies there braiding her tresses, just braiding her long tresses, and as soon as she finishes the world will come to an end.<br> Our people listened and listened and said: What&#x2019;s gold and silver?&#x201d; And the Chechens said: Gold is like fire, and silver is like moonlight, or when firelings light up.&#x201d; Our people said: Ah, so that&#x2019;s it. Go on and tell us some more.&#x201d; And the Chechens said: There&#x2019;s a great river, three years&#x2019; walk from here. In that river there&#x2019;s a fish Blue Fin. It talks with a human voice, cries and laughs, and swims back and forth across that river. When it swims to one side and laughs, the dawn starts playing, the sun rises up in the sky, and the day comes. When it goes back, it cries, drags the darkness with it, and hauls the moon by its tail. All the stars in the sky are Blue Fin&#x2019;s scales.&#x201d; We asked: Have you heard why winter comes and why summer goes?&#x201d; The old lady said: No, good people, we haven&#x2019;t heard, I won&#x2019;t lie, we haven&#x2019;t heard. It&#x2019;s true, though, folks wonder: Why do we need winter, when summer is so much sweeter? It must be for our sins.&#x201d; But the old man shook his head. No,&#x201d; he said, everything in nature must have its reason. A feller passing through once told me how it is. In the north there&#x2019;s a tree that grows right up to the clouds. Its trunk is black and gnarled, but its flowers are white, teeny tiny like a speck of dust. Father Frost lives in that tree, he&#x2019;s old and his beard is so long he tucks it into his belt. Now, when it comes time for winter, as soon as the chickens flock together and fly south, then that Old Man Frost gets busy: he starts jumping from branch to branch, clapping his hands and muttering doodle-dee- doo, doodle-dee-doo! And then he whistles: wheeeeooossshhhh! Then the wind comes up, and those white flowers come raining down on us and that&#x2019;s when you get snow. And you ask: Why does winter come?&#x201d; Our Golubchiks said: Yes, that&#x2019;s right. That must be the way it is. And you, Grandpa, aren&#x2019;t you afraid to walk the roads? What&#x2019;s it like at night? Have you come across any goblins?&#x201d; Oh, I met one once!&#x201d; said the Chechen. Seen him up close, I did, close as you are to me. Now hear what I say. My old woman had a hankering for some firelings. Bring me some firelings, she kept saying. And that year the firelings ripened sweet, nice and chewy. So off I go. Alone.&#x201d; What do you mean, alone!&#x201d; we gasped.<br> That&#x2019;s right, alone,&#x201d; boasted the stranger. Well, listen up. I was walking along, just walking, and it started getting dark. Not very dark, but, well, all gray-like. I was tiptoeing so as not to scare the firelings when suddenly: shush-shush-shush! What&#x2019;s that?&#x2019; I thought. I looked no one there. I went on. Again: shush-shush-shush. Like someone was shushing the leaves. I looked around. No one. I took another step. And there he was right in front of me. There was nothing there &#x2019;tall, and then all of a sudden I seen him. At arm&#x2019;s length. Just a little feller. Maybe up to my waist or chest. Looked like he were made of old hay, his eyes shone red and he had palms on his feet. And he was stomping those palms on the ground and chanting: pitter-patter, pitterpatter, pitter-patter. Did I run, let me tell you! Don&#x2019;t know how I ended up at home. My old lady didn&#x2019;t get her firelings that time.&#x201d; The children asked him: Grandfather, tell us what other monsters there are in the forest.&#x201d; They poured the old man some egg kvas and he started. I was young back then, hotheaded. Not afraid of a thing. Once I tied three logs together with reeds, set them on the water our river is fast and wide sat myself down on them, and off I floated. The honest truth! The women ran down to the bank, there was a hollering and a wailing, like you might expect. Where do you see people floating on the river? Nowadays, I&#x2019;m told, they hollow out trunks and put them on the water. If they&#x2019;re not lying, of course.&#x201d; No, they&#x2019;re not, they&#x2019;re not! It&#x2019;s our Fyodor Kuzmich, Glorybe. He invented it!&#x201d; we cried out, Benedikt loudest of all.<br> Don&#x2019;t know any Fyodor Kuzmich myself. We aren&#x2019;t booklearned. That&#x2019;s not my story. Like I said, I wasn&#x2019;t afraid of nothing. Not mermaids or water bubbles or wrigglers that live under stones. I even caught a whirlytooth fish in a bucket.&#x201d; Come on, Grandpa,&#x201d; our folks said. Now you&#x2019;re making things up.&#x201d; That&#x2019;s the honest truth! My missus here will tell you.&#x201d; It&#x2019;s true,&#x201d; the old lady said. It happened. How I yelled at him. He clean ruined my bucket, I had to burn it. Had to carve out a new one, and a new one, by the time you hollow it, tar it, let it dry three times, cure it with rusht, rub it with blue sand it near to broke my hands, I worked so hard. And for him, it&#x2019;s all glory. The whole village came out to look at him. Some were afraid.&#x201d; Of course they were,&#x201d; we said.<br> The old man was pleased. But then, you see, maybe I&#x2019;m the only one,&#x201d; he boasted. The only one seen a whirlytooth up close close as you folks there, he was and come out of it alive. Ha! I was a real he-man. Mighty! Sometimes I&#x2019;d yell so loud the window bladders would burst. And how much rusht I could drink at a sitting! I could suck a whole barrel dry.&#x201d; Benedikt&#x2019;s mother was sitting there, her lips pressed. What concrete benefit did you derive from your strength? Did you accomplish anything socially beneficial to the community?&#x201d; she asked.<br> The old man was offended. When I was a youngster, Golubushka, I could jump from here to that hill way over there on one leg! Beneficial! I tell you, sometimes I&#x2019;d give a shout and the straw would fall off the roof. All our folks is like that. A real strong man, I was. My missus here will tell you, if I get a blister or a boil it&#x2019;s as big as your fist. No joke. I had pimples that big, I tell you. That big. And you talk. I&#x2019;ll have you know when my old man scratched his head, he&#x2019;d shake off a half-bucket of dandruff.&#x201d; Come on, now,&#x201d; we piped up. Grandpa, you promised to tell us about monsters.&#x201d; But the old man wasn&#x2019;t joking, he was really mad. I&#x2019;m not saying another word. If you come to listen . . . then listen. Don&#x2019;t go butting in. It ruins the whole story. She must be one of them Oldeners, I can tell by the way she talks.&#x201d; That&#x2019;s right,&#x201d; said our people, throwing a side glance at Mother. One of the Oldeners. Come on now, Grandpa, go on.&#x201d; The Chechen also told us about forest ways, how to tell paths apart: which ones are for real and which are a figment, just green mist, a tangle of grasses, spells, and sorcery. He laid out all the signs. He told how the mermaid sings at dawn, burbles her watery songs; at first low-like, starting off deep: oooloo, oooloo, then up higher: ohouuaaa, ohouuaaa then hold on, watch out, or she&#x2019;ll pull you in the river and when the song reaches a whistle: iyee, iyee! run for your life, man. He told us about enchanted bark, and how you have to watch out for it; about the Snout that grabs people by their legs; and how to find the best rusht.<br> Then Benedikt spoke up. Grandfather, have you seen the Slynx?&#x201d; Everyone looked at Benedikt like he was an idiot. No one said anything, though.<br> They saw the fearless old man off on his way, and it was again quiet in town. They put more guards on, but no one else attacked...</p><h2>Foraging California: Finding, Identifying, And Preparing Edible Wild Foods In California (Foraging Series)</h2><p>From acacia to wild grape, <i>Foraging&nbsp;California</i> guides the reader to the edible wild foods and healthful herbs of the Golden State.

In <em>The Art and Science of Teaching: A Comprehensive Framework for Effective Instruction</em>, author Robert J. Marzano presents a model for ensuring quality teaching that balances the necessity of research-based data with the equally vital need to understand the strengths and weaknesses of individual students.<br><br>He articulates his framework in the form of 10 questions that represent a logical planning sequence for successful instructional design. For classroom lessons to be truly effective, educators must examine every component of the teaching process with equal resolve. Filled with charts, rubrics, and organizers, this methodical, user-friendly guide will help teachers examine and develop their knowledge and skills, so they can achieve that dynamic fusion of art and science that results in exceptional teaching and outstanding student achievement.</p><p>Dr. Robert J. Marzano is CEO and co-founder of Marzano Research Laboratory, which specializes in school reform efforts to enhance student academic achievement. Over his 40 years in education, the central theme of his work has been translating research and theory into practical programs and tools for teachers and administrators. He is the author of more than 30 books, 150 articles, and more than 100 curriculum guides and related materials for teachers and students.</p><h2>The Creation of Feminist Consciousness: From the Middle Ages to Eighteen-seventy (WOMEN AND HISTORY)</h2><p>A pioneer in women's studies and long-term activist for women's issues, and a past president of the Organization of American Historians, Gerda Lerner is one of the founders and foremost scholars of Women's History. <em>The Creation of Patriarchy</em>, the first book in her two-volume magnum opus <em>Women</em> <em>and History</em> (1986) received wide review attention and much acclaim, winning the prestigious Joan Kelly Prize of the American Historical Association for the best work on Women's History that year. <em>Ms</em> hailed the book for providing "a grand historical framework that was impossible even to imagine before the enlightenment about women's place in the world provided by her earlier work and that of other feminist scholars." <em>New Directions for Women</em> said it "may well be the most important work in feminist theory to appear in our generation."<br> <em>Patriarchy</em> traced the development of the ideas, symbols, and metaphors by which men institutionalized their domination of women. Now, in <em>The Creation of Feminist Consciousness</em>, the eagerly awaited concluding volume of <em>Women and History</em>, Lerner documents the twelve-hundred-year struggle of women to free their minds from patriarchal thought, to create Women's History, and to achieve a feminist consciousness. Lerner argues that the millenia-old educational disadvantaging of women and their marginalization in the intellectual life of Western civilization retarded women's ability to comprehend their condition and to define their needs as a group. She shows the devastating impact on women's psychology of notions of their innate mental inferiority, reinforced generation after generation by the teachings of family, church, and state. Through examining over a thousand years of feminist biblical criticism, Lerner illustrates her most important insight--the discontinuity of women's history. The generation to generation transmission of knowledge on which the building of civilization rests did not work for women. Because they did not know their history, each generation of women used their energies and talents reinventing ideas that other women had already defined--this greatly delayed the development of women's consciousness of themselves as members of a group. In a series of fascinating portraits of individual women who resisted patriarchal indoctrination, Lerner discusses women mystics such as Hildegard of Bingen, Julian of Norwich and later Protestant mystics, and brings to life the many women of great literary talent, from Christine de Pisan to Louise Labe to Emily Dickinson, who simply bypassed patriarchal thought and created alternate worlds for themselves.<br> In its emphasis on the force of ideas, the struggle of women for inclusion in the concept of the Divine, the repeated attempts by women to form supportive networks, and its analysis of the preconditions for the formation of political theories of liberation, this brilliant work charts new ground for historical studies, the history of ideas, and feminist theory.</p><p><br><em>About the Author:</em><br> <strong>Gerda Lerner</strong> is Robinson-Edwards Professor of History, <em>Emerita</em>, at the University of Wisconsin--Madison, and the author of 8 books in women's history.<br><br>"An essential document of the centuries of struggle that lie beneath the assumptions of cultural and political entitlement American women take for granted today."--<em>San Francisco Chronicle</em><p></p><br>"Powerful...exemplary in several senses of the word"--Katherine Gill, <em>The New York Times Book Review</em>.<p></p><br>"Gerda Lerner's prodigious efforts at putting raw history on the table ensure that her discoveries won't suffer from the obscurity that plagued pre-modern 'feminist' research. Her 'big-picture' revision of how we see the past should remain one of the enduring achievements by a contemporary American historian."--<em>The Philadelphia Inquirer</em><p></p><br>"In this wise, wonderful book, Gerda Lerner follows in the footsteps of her scholarly foremothers, but with a poignant difference. The thinking women before her, denied an intellectual tradition for twelve hundred years, thought and wrote in isolation. Looking back in righteous and rightful indignation, Lerner remedies the very tragedy she analyses. Everyone who thinks about women's thinking should read this book, discover our heritage, and contemplate its interruptions."--Nell Irvin Painter, Edwards Professor of American History, <em>Princeton University</em><p></p><br>"Splendid....This sharp, incisive book concludes the work Lerner so well began in <em>The Creation of Patriarchy</em>. Together they make up a vital contribution to women's studies."--<em>Booklist</em><p></p><br>"Lerner documents the 1,200-year struggle of women to free their minds from patriarchal though, create women's history, and achieve a feminist consciousness."--<em>Feminist Bookstore News</em><p></p><br>"Impressive."--<em>The Milwaukee Journal</em><p></p><br>"Based on wide-ranging research....Lively and provocative."--<em>Library Journal</em><p></p><br>"Sweeping and erudite....The evidence here is perhaps unique."--<em>Kirkus Reviews</em><p></p><br>"Densely researched, accessible and engrossing conclusion to Lerner's two-volume study Women in History....Lerner helped pioneer the study of women and history and remains preeminent in the field."--<em>Publishers Weekly</em><p></p><br></p><h2>Black Magic: Religion and the African American Conjuring Tradition</h2><p><i>Black Magic </i>looks at the origins, meaning, and uses of Conjure&#x2015;the African American tradition of healing and harming that evolved from African, European, and American elements&#x2015;from the slavery period to well into the twentieth century. Illuminating a world that is dimly understood by both scholars and the general public, Yvonne P. Chireau describes Conjure and other related traditions, such as Hoodoo and Rootworking, in a beautifully written, richly detailed history that presents the voices and experiences of African Americans and shows how magic has informed their culture. Focusing on the relationship between Conjure and Christianity, Chireau shows how these seemingly contradictory traditions have worked together in a complex and complementary fashion to provide spiritual empowerment for African Americans, both slave and free, living in white America. <br><br>As she explores the role of Conjure for African Americans and looks at the transformations of Conjure over time, Chireau also rewrites the dichotomy between magic and religion. With its groundbreaking analysis of an often misunderstood tradition, this book adds an important perspective to our understanding of the myriad dimensions of human spirituality.</p><p>"Chireau has written a marvelous text on an important dimension of African American religious culture. Expanding beyond the usual focus of scholarship on Christianity, she describes and analyzes the world of magical-medical-religious practice, challenging hallowed distinctions among "religion" and "magic." Anyone interested in African American religion will need to reckon seriously with Chireau's text on conjure."&#x2015;Albert J. Raboteau, Princeton University<br><br>"Deprived of their own traditions and defined as chattel, enslaved Africans formed a new orientation in America. Conjuring&#x2015;operating alongside of and within both the remnants of African culture and the acquired traditions of North America&#x2015;served as a theoretical and practical mode of deciphering and divining within this, enabling them to create an alternate meaning of life in the New World. Chireau's is the first full-scale treatment of this important dimension of African American culture and religion. A wonderful book!"&#x2015;Charles H.

Only nature seems to restore him to a sense of balance.&nbsp;In the words of Allen Ginsberg,<i> Big Sur</i> "reveals consciousness in all its syntactic elaboration, detailing the luminous emptiness of his own paranoiac confusion."</p><p>Jack Kerouac(1922-1969), the central figure of the Beat Generation, was born in Lowell, Massachusetts, in 1922 and died in St. Petersburg, Florida, in 1969. Among his many novels are <b>On the Road</b>, <b>The Dharma Bums</b>, <b>Big Sur</b>, and <b>Visions of Cody</b>.This autobiographical novel continues the adventures of the (older but certainly not mellower) wandering beatnik from ON THE ROAD. For a narrator it contains extraordinary difficulties, for the writing flies off into inebriated, overly long sentences that reflect, describe or just babble forward in a kind of free association. To keep such passages flowing while making sense out of them is no mean feat. Tom Parker pulls it off, erring only infrequently in his interpretation. He even manages to sound as if he were enjoying himself. The production is clean but tinny, possibly dampening the pleasure of home listeners, but hardly bothering drivers listening over traffic noise. Y.R.

Like its predecessors, this new edition adopts a thematic approach, investigating the impact of social forces such as industrialization, urbanization, immigration, globalization, and cultural conflict on the development of schools and other educational institutions. It also examines the various ways that schools have contributed to social change, particularly in enhancing the status and accomplishments of certain social groups and not others. Detailed accounts of the experiences of women and minority groups in American history consider how their lives have been affected by education, while "Focal Point" sections within each chapter allow the reader to hone in on key moments in history and their relevance within the broader scope of American schooling from the colonial era to the present.</p> <p>This new edition has been comprehensively updated and edited for greater readability and clarity. It offers a revised final chapter, updated to include recent change in education politics and policy, in particular the decline of No Child Left Behind and the impact of the Common Core and movements against it. Further additions include enhanced coverage of colonial and early post-colonial American schooling, added materials on persistent issues such as race in education, an updated discussion of the GED program, and a closer look at the role of technology in schools. With its nuanced treatment of both historical and contemporary factors influencing the modern school system, this book remains an excellent resource for investigating and critiquing the social, economic, and cultural development of American education.</p></p><p><p><strong>John L.

While students quickly realize the answer is &#x2018;both,&#x2019; this interplay throughout the text works nicely for me.

Somerset Maugham</b>&nbsp;(1874-1965) lived in Paris until he was ten. He was educated at King's School, Canterbury, and at Heidelberg University. He afterwards walked the wards of St. Thomas's Hospital with a view to practice in medicine, but the success of his first novel,&nbsp;<b>Liza of Lambeth</b>&nbsp;(1897), won him over to letters. Something of his hospital experience is reflected, however, in the first of his masterpieces,&nbsp;<b>Of Human Bondage</b>&nbsp;(1915), and with&nbsp;<b>The Moon and Sixpence</b>&nbsp;(1919) his reputation as a novelist was assured.<br><br>His position as one of the most successful playwrights on the London stage was being consolidated simultaneously. His first play,&nbsp;<b>A Man of Honour</b>&nbsp;(1903), was followed by a procession of successes just before and after the First World War. (At one point only Bernard Shaw had more plays running at the same time in London.) His theatre career ended with&nbsp;<b>Sheppey</b>&nbsp;(1933).&nbsp;His fame as a short-story writer began with&nbsp;<b>The Trembling of a Leaf</b>, sub-titled&nbsp;<b>Little Stories of the South Sea Islands</b>, in 1921, after which he published more than ten collections.<br><br>W. Somerset Maugham's general books are fewer in number.

You need only observe the world around you to discover how substantially the ideas of history's thinkers affect us still. You can hear it in the beliefs of your non-Christian friends. In the media, your music, your children's classrooms. You can see it in our public policies, on every bookstore shelf, in the way we understand our very existence--even in the church.</p> <p>We like to believe that we create our little worlds from scratch and then live in them. But the reality is, we step into an environment that already exists, and <em>we</em> learn to interact with <em>it</em>. The game has been conceived long before us; the rules and boundaries already decided.</p> <p>We may be amused when Ren� Descartes labors so long in order to conclude that he exists, or puzzled by Immanuel Kant spending his life analyzing how we know anything. Yet these men were not simply contemplating minutiae. The foundational thinking of philosophy tries to lay bare all of our assumptions, revealing our false and sometimes dangerous beliefs so that we may arrive at a coherent worldview.</p> <p>The greater our familiarity with the ideas that have shaped our culture over the centuries, the greater our ability to understand--and influence--that culture for Christ. From ancient Greek thinkers like Plato and Aristotle to Christian philosophers like Augustine and Aquinas to the molders of modern thought such as Kant and Nietszche, R. C. Sproul traces the contours of Western philosophy throughout history and demonstrates the massive consequences these ideas have had on world events, theology, the arts, and culture--as well as in our everyday lives.</p></p><p><p><strong>R.

His radio program, <em>Renewing Your Mind</em>, is still broadcast daily on hundreds of radio stations around the world and can also be heard online. Sproul contributed dozens of articles to national evangelical publications, spoke at conferences, churches, colleges, and seminaries around the world, and wrote more than one hundred books, including <em>The Holiness of God</em>, <em>Chosen by God</em>, and <em>Everyone&#x2019;s a Theologian</em>.

Through the actions of the great Qing emperors and the dominant figures of this century - Mao Zedong, Chiang Kai-Shek, Zhou Enlai, Deng Xiao-Ping - we see a state struggling to establish harmony within, and its autonomy in the world.

When Hanna Heath gets a call in the middle of the night in her Sydney home about a precious medieval manuscript that has been recovered from the smouldering ruins of war-torn Sarajevo, she knows she is on the brink of the experience of a lifetime. A renowned book conservator, she must now make her way to Bosnia to start work on restoring the Sarajevo Haggadah - a Jewish prayer book - to discover its secrets and piece together the story of its miraculous survival. But the trip will also set in motion a series of events that threaten to rock Hanna&#39;s orderly life, including her encounter with Ozren Karamen, the young librarian who risked his life to save the book. As meticulously researched as all of Brooks&#39; previous work, People of the Book is a gripping and moving novel about war, art, love and survival. Shortlisted for the 2009 Prime Minister&#39;s Literary Awards. Australian Book Industry Awards Book of the Year. &#39;an imaginative tour de force&#39; Good Weekend &#39;intelligent, thoughtful, gracefully written and original&#39; Washington Post &#39;a fearless and engaging writer&#39; Courier-Mail</p><p>Amazon Best of the Month, January 2008: One of the earliest Jewish religious volumes to be illuminated with images, the Sarajevo Haggadah survived centuries of purges and wars thanks to people of all faiths who risked their lives to safeguard it. Geraldine Brooks, the Pulitzer Prize-winning author of March, has turned the intriguing but sparely detailed history of this precious volume into an emotionally rich, thrilling fictionalization that retraces its turbulent journey. In the hands of Hanna Heath, an impassioned rare-book expert restoring the manuscript in 1996 Sarajevo, it yields clues to its guardians and whereabouts: an insect wing, a wine stain, salt crystals, and a white hair. While readers experience crucial moments in the book's history through a series of fascinating, fleshed-out short stories, Hanna pursues its secrets scientifically, and finds that some interests will still risk everything in the name of protecting this treasure. A complex love story, thrilling mystery, vivid history lesson, and celebration of the enduring power of ideas, <i>People of the Book</i> will surely be hailed as one of the best of 2008. <i>--Mari Malcolm</i> <p> </p><p></p><p></p><b>Geraldine Brooks </b>is the author of four novels, the Pulitzer Prize-winning <i>March</i> and the international bestsellers <i>Caleb's Crossing</i>, <i>People of the Book</i>, and <i>Year of Wonders</i>.

He fell in love with the black mistress of the warder and discovered too late that to love is not safe; he attempted to keep a record of the strange reality he saw in prison, only to realize that history is not written by those who are ruled.<br><br>Acclaimed as a masterpiece around the world, <i>Gould&#x2019;s Book of Fish</i> is at once a marvelously imagined epic of nineteenth-century Australia and a contemporary fable, a tale of horror, and a celebration of love, all transformed by a convict painter into pictures of fish.</b></p><p><i>Gould's Book of Fish</i>, an extraordinary work of fact-based fiction by Tasmanian author Richard Flanagan (<i>Death of a River Guide</i>) is a journey through the fringe madness of Down Under colonialism. Set during the 1830s in a hellish island prison colony off the Tasmanian coast, the novel plucks a real-life thief and prisoner, English forger William Buelow Gould, from the pages of history to act as protagonist-narrator. Through Gould's unique capacity to blend hyperbole, hyperrealism, and self-effacing honesty, the reader acquires a shockingly clear picture of daily torment on the island. Yet more remarkable is Gould's portrait of bizarre ambitions among prison authorities to further principles of art and science amidst so much misery. Key to such plans is Gould's talent as a painter and illustrator. The compound's surgeon, nursing hopes of publishing a definitive guide to the island's fish, leans heavily on Gould's ability to record the taxonomy of various species. Though Gould accommodates his masters, the manuscript, in his hands, becomes testimony to their perverse dreams of civilization and his own quick-witted survival instincts. Throughout, Flanagan never loses the well-imagined voice of Gould's candor or the character's dense descriptive powers, talents that translate into a thrilling text that reads like a blend of Melville and Burgess. <i>--Tom Keogh</i>Richard Flanagan is the author of Death of a River Guide (Picador) and The Sound of One Hand Clapping (Picador), both of which were published to international acclaim.</p><h2>Loose Leaf for Anatomy and Physiology: The Unity of Form and Function</h2><p>Master the story of Anatomy &amp; Physiology with Saladin's Anatomy &amp; Physiology: The Unity of Form and Function!

These are years of searching, when most people make formative life decisions, for good and for ill. Looking for place and purpose in a changing world and asking new questions of meaning and faith, young adults reexamine their earlier beliefs and assumptions, as they encounter a bewildering array of new experiences and complex choices. In today's society, too many wander through this challenging time alone, without the presence of mentoring voices. <p>Building on the foundation she established in her classic work, The Critical Years, Sharon Daloz Parks urges thoughtful adults to assume responsibility for providing strategic mentorship during this important decade in life. She reveals also, however, the ways young adults are influenced not only by individual mentors but also by mentoring environments.</p> <p>Furthermore, Parks asserts, the wider culture as a whole plays a mentoring role in the formation of each new generation of young adults, shaping the future of the culture itself. Through exploring young adult meaning-making and faith, and particularly the power of adult mentors to determine its quality, we may more fully recognize how young adults and their mentors can fuel the power and promise of cultural renewal.</p> <p>Parks draws on her own research and insights from developmental psychology, religion, theology, leadership, and ethics to examine the underlying developmental patterns of this unique time of life&#x2014;when one is no longer an adolescent and yet not quite fully adult. She shares a wealth of practical experience gained from thirty years of working with young adults. Through thought-provoking examples from across a broad range of contexts, professionals, educators, community leaders, supervisors, and parents will discover the many ways they can responsibly serve as guides and mentors to young adults, thus making a vital investment in the promise of the twenty-first century.</p> <p><br> </p>SHARON DALOZ PARKS is an associate director and member of the faculty at the Whidbey Institute, near Seattle.

Enloe offers a feminist gender analysis of the global politics of both masculinities and femininities, dismantles an apparently overwhelming world system, and reveals that system to be much more fragile and open to change than we think.</p><p>"This is the work of a well-travelled feminist mulling over the inequalities of the postmodern world. In a lively overview of tourism, the food industry, army bases, nationalism, diplomacy, global factories, and domestic work, Enloe persuasively argues that gender is key to the workings of international relations."&#x2015;Aihwa Ong, University of California, Berkeley<br><br> "If you thought you understood how our world works, think again. Get ready to look at your jeans, your breakfast, and your morning paper in a whole new light. This book made my brain hurt, in the best way."&#x2015;Sohaila Abdulali, author of <i>Year of the Tiger</i><br><br> "The third edition of <i>Bananas, Beaches and Bases</i> demonstrates beyond all doubt the enduring&nbsp;brilliance of Cynthia Enloe&#x2019;s fastidious documenting of women&#x2019;s lives as they shape, and are shaped&nbsp;by the power-play of international politics. In sharpening and freshening feminist curiosity in the&nbsp;contemporary period, this edition reminds us of both the stubborn tenacity of gendered inequality&nbsp;as it is etched into everyday life and, in more optimistic terms, the potentially transformative&nbsp;capacity with which women&#x2019;s lives inhere. A gritty yet erudite text illuminating the international&nbsp;topography of the current day, global gender regime of interest to fresh eyes as well as readers&nbsp;looking to get a handle on patriarchy&#x2019;s mutability."&#x2015;Dr Paul Higate, Reader in Gender &amp; Security at the School for Sociology, Politics and International&nbsp;Studies, the University of Bristol and editor of <i>Military Masculinities: Identity and the State</i> (Praeger:&nbsp;Greenwood)<br><br> "This book is a rare gem. After having read it, international relations will never look the same again. Through bananas, beaches, bases and the many lives women live Cynthia Enloe most persuasively shows that global politics is not where it is supposed to be. A third, updated edition of this classic is very welcome indeed."&#x2015;Jef Huysmans, Professor of Security Studies, The Open University (UK)<br><br> "To change the world�s inequalities, we need texts that illuminate how power operates and hence how our personal power matters. An exemplary teaching tool, Enloe�s text simultaneously informs, entertains, disturbs and even inspires."&#x2015;V. Spike Peterson, Professor of International Relations, Univ of Arizona, Tucson AZ<br><br> "As I hold the Turkish translation of the first Bananas, I wonder how many readers, in how many languages have been inspired to look at our worlds - and imagine new worlds - through the &#x2018;gender-curious feminist eyes&#x2019; that Cynthia Enloe offers as a gift to us all. Making connecting between an amazing array of contemporary conversations and struggles, this Bananas is not a revised gift, it is a whole new gift! It impressively shows that if we miss gender, we simply miss how the world &#x2013; and certainly international politics &#x2013; goes round."&#x2015;Ayse G�l Altinay,&nbsp;Cultural Anthropologist, Sabanci University and author of <i>The Myth of the Military-Nation</i><br><br> "As breathtaking as the first edition, Bananas, Beaches and Bases breaks new ground once again, compelling the reader to take a fresh feminist look at the gendered international politics of the &#x201c;personal&#x201d; in the age of social media."&#x2015;Catia Cecilia Confortini, Assistant Professor, Peace &amp; Justice Studies Program, Wellesley College<br><br> "Cynthia Enloe&#x2019;s unparalleled skill in making the everyday lives of women visible in&nbsp;and relevant to international politics is on full display as she employs her feminist&nbsp;curiosity to challenge the boundaries of the &#x201c;international.&#x201d; Listening carefully&nbsp;and not afraid to admit surprise, Enloe weaves a tapestry of stories that reveal the&nbsp;workings of power from the personal to the political and back. Her sustained and&nbsp;deeply political engagement with women from all walks of life &#x2013; all over the world&nbsp;&#x2013; makes us genuinely smarter about global politics.

The contributors--all leading scholars working at the cutting edge of Egyptology--incorporate the latest findings in archaeological research as they chart the principal political events of Egyptian history, from the rise of the Pharaohs and the conquest of Egypt by Alexander the Great, to the ascension of the Ptolemies and the coming of Roman legions. The book also includes the first detailed examinations of three periods which were previously regarded as "dark ages." Against the backdrop of the birth and death of ruling dynasties, the writers also examine cultural and social patterns, including stylistic developments in art and literature, monumental architecture, funerary beliefs, and much more. The contributors illuminate the underlying patterns of social and political change and describe the changing face of ancient Egypt, from the biographical details of individuals to the social and economic factors that shaped the lives of the people as a whole. <br> The only up-to-date, single-volume history of ancient Egypt available in English, <em>The Oxford History of Ancient Egypt</em> is a "must read" for everyone interested in one of the great civilizations of antiquity.</p><p>One of the most vexing problems in Egyptology is the question of establishing reliable chronologies, whether through relative methods such as stratigraphy and the dating of artifacts or through more absolute time horizons established by astronomical ephemera or radiometric dating. In this overview of ancient Egypt--meant for advanced students, but accessible to general readers with an interest in the area--Ian Shaw and 13 contributors pay close attention to issues of chronology, reconciling conflicts of dating that mark older scholarship.<p> While doing so, they address other problems in the study of ancient Egypt, such as the lack of material evidence of early humans in the region and the increasing destruction of sites in the face of contemporary urban growth. Elsewhere, they remark on the principal developments that distinguish periods in Egyptian prehistory, such as the Old Kingdom's use of large-scale building projects to consolidate power and "remind people of the greatness of pharaonic civilization," and the Middle and New kingdoms' apparent openness to foreigners, which lent Egypt a cosmopolitan, multicultural air that persisted for centuries during long periods of domination by outside powers such as Persia and Rome. Highly useful as a reference and survey, this handsomely illustrated book is a fine addition to any Egyptophile's collection. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i></p><br><strong>Ian Shaw</strong> is Lecturer in Egyptian Archaeology at the Institute of Archaeology, University College, London.<br></p><h2>Ceramics: A Potter&#39;s Handbook</h2><p>This classic handbook introduces students to the fundamentals of the ceramic arts, beginning with a comprehensive history of ceramic materials, techniques, and practices up to the present day and then moving to a detailed presentation of ceramic techniques from the most basic to the complex.

But the history of suffrage in the U.S. is, in fact,the story of a struggle to achieve this right by our society's marginalized groups. In The Right to Vote, Duke historian Alexander Keyssar explores the evolution of suffrage over the course of the nation's history. Examining the many features of the history of the right to vote in the U.S.&#x2014;class, ethnicity, race, gender, religion, and age&#x2014;the book explores the conditions under which American democracy has expanded and contracted over the years.Keyssar presents convincing evidence that the history of the right to vote has not been one of a steady history of expansion and increasing inclusion, noting that voting rights contracted substantially in the U.S. between 1850 and 1920. Keyssar also presents a controversial thesis: that the primary factor promoting the expansion of the suffrage has been war and the primary factors promoting contraction or delaying expansion have been class tension and class conflict.</p><p>Alexander Keyssar is Professor of History and Public Policy at Duke University. He is the author of Out of Work: The First Century of Unemployment in Massachusetts (A New York Times Notable Book for 1986) and has written essays and reviews for The Nation, Times Literary Supplement, the New York Times, The New Republic, and a host of other popular and academic publications.HAmerica's self-image as the land of democracy flows from the belief that we've long enjoyed universal suffrageDor at least aspired to it. Duke historian Keyssar (Out of Work: The First Century of Unemployment in Massachusetts) convincingly shows that, though distinctive in some ways, the evolution of the franchise in America is similar to that in other countries: highly contested, with retreats as well as advances, containing within it the sharp reflections of larger struggles for power. America's basic claim to exceptionalismDearly white manhood suffrageDwas, according to Keyssar, part historical accident and part mistake, adopted before a European-style urban working class emerged. Keyssar identifies four periods: one of expansion from the Constitution's signing to around 1850; a period of contraction lasting until around WWI, in which the upper and middle classes demonstrated hostility to universal suffrage; a period of mixed, minor adjustments lasting till the 1960s, when the fourth period beganDthe civil rights movementDwhich inaugurated the removal of most of the remaining barriers. Various historical dynamics, such as economic development, immigration and class relations, underlie this periodization, expressed, Keyssar says, in shifting ideologies: voting as a right versus voting as a privilege or trust, while lack of financial independence was repeatedly used to justify excluding whole categories of voters. These large background shifts outline the tortured ebb and flow of suffrage: the post-Civil War enfranchisement of blacks and its rollback, the 70-year struggle for women's suffrage, the restoration of black voting rights in the 1960s. This is a masterful historical account of a complex, contradictory legacy. <br>Copyright 2000 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Marks&#39; Standard Handbook for Mechanical Engineers</h2><p>Newly revised and expanded Marks!

Sandall, Ph.D., &amp; Ilene S. Schwartz, Ph.D.</p><p>Copyright� 2008 by Paul H. Brookes Publishing Co. All rights reserved. No part of this excerpt may be reproduced or reprinted without permission in writing from the publisher.</p> When early childhood teachers plan their activities for the day for their whole class, they can add an extra layer of planning to simultaneously meet the learning objectives of their students with special needs. Embedded learning opportunities (ELOs) are short teaching episodes that teachers set up for when there is a good match between classroom activities and a child's individual learning objectives.<p> Classroom activities are planned to help all children learn valued concepts and skills. Teachers then create teaching episodes designed to ensure children with individual objectives engage more fully in the activities. With the use of the ELOs, it is presumed that the teacher and team are already using a high-quality curriculum and appropriate standards to guide their planning.</p><p> Using ELOs has a number of benefits:</p><p></p><ol><li>Since ongoing activities and routines are used, big changes to the classroom are not required. </li><li>Choosing activities that match a child's interests and preferences enhances the child's motivation to participate and learn. </li><li>Because the teaching takes place in the natural setting of the classroom, the child is more likely to use the newly learned skill by him- or herself in familiar environments. </li><li>When the teacher provides ELOs several times during the day and during different activities, the child's ability to use the skill in a variety of situations is increased. </li></ol><p> The Basic Steps</p><p> Using ELOs sounds like a natural thing to do. However, teachers must plan very carefully to ensure that during the teaching episodes, children with special needs are able to adequately practice their skills. Seven basic steps are necessary for planning and implementing ELOs:</p><p></p><ol><li>Clarify the learning objective and determine the criterion. </li><li>Gather baseline information to determine the child's current level of performance. </li><li>Use an activity matrix to select activities, learning centers, or classroom routines in which instruction can reasonably be embedded. </li><li>Design the instructional interaction, and write it on a planning form. You can use an ELO-at-a-Glance (see a sample in the free download above), which tells exactly what will happen during a teaching episode (adapted from McCormick &amp; Feeney's "IEP-at-a-Glance" [1995]). </li><li>Implement the instruction as planned, remembering these tips: </li><br><ul><li>Give clear instructions. </li><li>Let the child respond. </li><li>Provide feedback. </li><br></ul><li>Keep track of the opportunities provided. </li><li>Periodically check to find out if the child has achieved the objective. </li><i>Adapted from</i> Building Blocks for Teaching Preschoolers with Special Needs, Second Edition by Susan R.

Schwartz.<p><b>Example: How to help Samisha increase her cooperative play skills</b></p><p><i>One of Samisha's learning objectives focused on increasing her cooperative play skills with peers. One of the ways Samisha's teachers decided to work on this was to embed planned teaching and learning opportunities in the classroom's free-choice time. The classroom features a learning center where the children can play with board games, such as Lotto. During free-choice time, Gia and David planned to invite Samisha to the game table when other children who were more skilled players would be there. David then used prompts and encouragement to help Samisha learn the game and play cooperatively with her peers.</i></p><p> In this example, instead of setting up a special or separate time for Samisha to learn and practice cooperative play skills, her teachers did some extra planning so that they could embed the necessary instruction (in this case, using systematic prompting and encouragement) within the ongoing free-choice activities. More specifically:</p><p><i>Samisha's learning objective states that during play times, Samisha will join her peers in play and maintain play with them for 10 minutes or more in cooperative play activities. She will demonstrate this in four different play areas. Samisha's teachers completed the Child Assessment Worksheet, examined their daily schedule, and observed and took notes on Samisha's play during free-choice time. They noted that Samisha can take part in coooperative play in the dramatic play area but only if she initiates the story line. Even then, her cooperative play lasts only a couple of minutes. Gia and David also noted that Samisha has started to watch other children play games in the table game center. </i></p><p><i>One of the important considerations for Samisha's teachers is that there are six children with disabilities in the classroom, and many of the children have objectives that could be embedded during free-choice time. Gia and David need to be creative and realistic about how to use their time and resources. They decided to embed instruction on cooperative play at the table game center. Once Samisha is successful, they will work on this objective in other play areas. The current plan means that one adult will work with three or four children. The structure of the game and systematic use of prompting will help Samisha learn to play with the other children. The teachers developed an ELO-at-a-Glance for Samisha. </i></p><p><i>To maximize their time and resources, Gia and David could decide to use this same activity during free-choice time to embed instruction for another child in the class. Joey is one of Samisha's classmates. He also likes to play at the game table. This could be a prime time for the teacher (who is already there) to embed instruction on one of Joey's objectives: Joey will release a handheld object onto or into a larger target with either hand. The teachers select the game's playing pieces with Joey in mind and then use the slight minimal assistance he needs to help him place the playing piece on the appropriate section of the board game.</i></p><p> See Samisha's sample Child Assessment Worksheet and ELO-at-a-Glance in the free dowload above. </p></ol><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p></p><h2>Thinking Through the Past: A Critical Thinking Approach to U.S. History, Volume 1</h2><p>This anthology for U.S. history gives readers the opportunity to apply critical thinking skills to the examination of historical sources, providing pedagogy and background information to help them draw substantive conclusions.

I found Hollitz's work to be particularly engaging."</p><h2>Encountering Development</h2><p><p>How did the industrialized nations of North America and Europe come to be seen as the appropriate models for post-World War II societies in Asia, Africa, and Latin America? How did the postwar discourse on development actually create the so-called Third World? And what will happen when development ideology collapses? To answer these questions, Arturo Escobar shows how development policies became mechanisms of control that were just as pervasive and effective as their colonial counterparts. The development apparatus generated categories powerful enough to shape the thinking even of its occasional critics while poverty and hunger became widespread. "Development" was not even partially "deconstructed" until the 1980s, when new tools for analyzing the representation of social reality were applied to specific "Third World" cases. Here Escobar deploys these new techniques in a provocative analysis of development discourse and practice in general, concluding with a discussion of alternative visions for a postdevelopment era.</p><br><p>Escobar emphasizes the role of economists in development discourse--his case study of Colombia demonstrates that the economization of food resulted in ambitious plans, and more hunger. To depict the production of knowledge and power in other development fields, the author shows how peasants, women, and nature became objects of knowledge and targets of power under the "gaze of experts."</p></p><p><p>"An intelligent and thorough overview of the rise of the concept of 'development' . . . .

They are also, more simply, the vibrantly sketched adventures of a uniquely American antihero named Henry. Henry falls in and out of love, and is in and out of the hospital; he sings of joy and desire, and of beings at odds with the world. He is lustful; he is depressed.<br> And while Henry is breaking down and cracking up and patching himself together again, Berryman is doing the same thing to the English language, crafting electric verses that defy grammar but resound with an intuitive truth: "if he had a hundred years," Henry despairs in "Dream Song 29," "&amp; more, &amp; weeping, sleepless, in all them time / Henry could not make good."<br> This volume collects both <i>77 Dream Songs</i>, which won Berryman the Pulitzer Prize in 1965, and their continuation, <i>His Toy, His Dream, His Rest</i>, which was awarded the National Book Award and the Bollingen Prize in 1969. <i>The Dream Songs</i> are witty and wild, an account of madness shot through with searing insight, winking word play, and moments of pure, soaring elation.

Andrew Louth aims to redress the balance. Recognizing that the intellectual form of this tradition was decisively influenced by Platonic ideas of the soul&#39;s relationship to God, Louth begins with an examination of Plato and Platonism. The discussion of the Fathers which follows shows how the mystical tradition is at the heart of their thought and how the dogmatic tradition both molds and is the reflection of mystical insights and concerns. This new edition of a classic study of the diverse influences upon Christian spirituality includes a new Epilogue which brings the text completely up to date.</p><p>One reviewer of this book wrote, "it is not often that we chance to meet with a book so rich that it would be impossible to discuss it in full without writing another one at least as long." Originally given as a series of lectures in the Faculty of Theology at the Oxford University, <i>The Origins of the Christian Mystical Tradition</i> is a superb introduction to the sometimes fog-filled subject of Christian mysticism. Focusing on the early centuries of the faith, Louth first explores the influence of Plato and Platonism on Christian writers, and then devotes individual chapters to key theologians: Athanasius and Gregory of Nyssa, Augustine, and Denys the Areopagite, also known as Pseudo-Dionysius. In his final two chapters he looks at the relationship between the mysticism of the early church fathers and that of St. John of the Cross, perhaps the most influential mystic in the history of the church, and he explores the distinctive character of Christian mysticism. <p> While challenging reading, Louth is a clear and straightforward thinker and writer. <i>The Origins of the Christian Mystical Tradition</i> will lead the discerning reader onto a path through some of the most exciting and ecstatic spiritual writing in any tradition. <i>--Doug Thorpe</i></p><br>Andrew Louth is Professor of Patristic and Byzantine Studies, University of Durham.<br></p><h2>Paint Red Hot Landscapes That Sell!: A Sure-Fire Way to Stop Boring and Start Selling Everything You Paint in Oils</h2><p>Mike Svob knows all about producing paintings that sell.

Because Photoshop has so much power and depth, sometimes the things you need are...well...kinda hidden or not really obvious. There will be a lot of times when you need to get something done in Photoshop, and you know Photoshop can do it (because Photoshop can do just about anything), but you have no idea where Adobe hid that feature, or what the &#x201c;secret handshake&#x201d; is to do that thing you need now so you can get back to working on your images. That&#x2019;s why this book was created: to quickly get you to the technique, the shortcut, the setting, or exactly the right thing you need to do right now.<br><br>Here&#x2019;s how it works: When you need to know how to do a particular thing, you turn to the chapter where it would be found (Layers, Printing, Fixing Problems, Special Effects, etc.), find the thing you need to do (it&#x2019;s easy, each page covers just one single topic), and Scott tells you exactly how to do it just like he was sitting there beside you, using the same casual style as if he were telling a friend. That way, you get back to editing your images fast.<br><br>This isn&#x2019;t a book of theory, full of confusing jargon and detailed multi-step concepts. This is a book on which button to click, which setting to use, and exactly how and when to use it, so you&#x2019;re never &#x201c;stuck&#x201d; in Photoshop again. This will be your &#x201c;go to&#x201d; book that sits within reach any time you&#x2019;re working in Photoshop, and you are going to love having this type of help right at your fingertips.<br><br>TABLE OF CONTENTS<br><ul>Chapter 1: How to Get Around Like a Pro</ul><ul>Chapter 2: How to Use Photoshop&#x2019;s Tools</ul><ul>Chapter 3: How to Use Camera Raw Like a Boss</ul><ul>Chapter 4: How to Use Camera Raw&#x2019;s Adjustment Brush</ul><ul>Chapter 5: How to Crop, Resize &amp; Stuff Like That</ul><ul>Chapter 6: How to Work with Layers</ul><ul>Chapter 7: How to Adjust Your Images</ul><ul>Chapter 8: How to Fix Problems</ul><ul>Chapter 9: How to Make Beautiful Prints</ul><ul>Chapter 10: How to Edit Video</ul><ul>Chapter 11: How to Do the Most Popular Special Effects</ul><ul>Chapter 12: How to Sharpen Your Images</ul><ul>Chapter 13: Other Stuff You&#x2019;ll Want to Know</ul></p><p>Scott Kelby is the world&#x2019;s #1 best-selling author of photography technique books, as well as Editor and Publisher of the highly acclaimed Photoshop User magazine.

Here are some of the remarkable features of <i>Barnes &amp; Noble Classics</i>:<ul><li>New introductions commissioned from today's top writers and scholars </li><li>Biographies of the authors </li><li>Chronologies of contemporary historical, biographical, and cultural events </li><li>Footnotes and endnotes </li><li>Selective discussions of imitations, parodies, poems, books, plays, paintings, operas, statuary, and films inspired by the work </li><li>Comments by other famous authors </li><li>Study questions to challenge the reader's viewpoints and expectations </li><li>Bibliographies for further reading </li><li>Indices &amp; Glossaries, when appropriate</li></ul>All editions are beautifully designed and are printed to superior specifications; some include illustrations of historical interest. <i>Barnes &amp; Noble Classics </i>pulls together a constellation of influences biographical, historical, and literary to enrich each reader's understanding of these enduring works.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>Vladimir Nabokov called Leo Tolstoy&#x2019;s <i>Anna Karenina</i> one of the greatest love stories in world literature.&#x201d; Matthew Arnold claimed it was not so much a work of art as a piece of life.&#x201d; Set in imperial Russia, <i>Anna Karenina</i> is a rich and complex meditation on passionate love and disastrous infidelity.<br><br>Married to a powerful government minister, Anna Karenina is a beautiful woman who falls deeply in love with a wealthy army officer, the elegant Count Vronsky. Desperate to find truth and meaning in her life, she rashly defies the conventions of Russian society and leaves her husband and son to live with her lover. Condemned and ostracized by her peers and prone to fits of jealousy that alienate Vronsky, Anna finds herself unable to escape an increasingly hopeless situation.<br><br>Set against this tragic affair is the story of Konstantin Levin, a melancholy landowner whom Tolstoy based largely on himself. While Anna looks for happiness through love, Levin embarks on his own search for spiritual fulfillment through marriage, family, and hard work. Surrounding these two central plot threads are dozens of characters whom Tolstoy seamlessly weaves together, creating a breathtaking tapestry of nineteenth-century Russian society.<br><br>From its famous opening sentence Happy families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way&#x201d; to its stunningly tragic conclusion, this enduring tale of marriage and adultery plumbs the very depths of the human soul.<br></p><p><b>Amy Mandelker</b>, Associate Professor of Comparative Literature at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York, is the author of <i>Framing Anna Karenina: Tolstoy, the Woman Question, and the Victorian Novel</i> and coeditor of <i>Approaches to Teaching Anna Karenina</i>.</p></p><p>This edition, the famous Constance Garnett translation, has been revised throughout by Leonard J. Kent and Nina Berberova.<br><br>"Happy families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way."&nbsp;&nbsp;So begins <b>Anna Karenina</b>, Leo Tolstoy's great modern novel of an adulterous affair set against the backdrop of Moscow and St. Petersburg high society in the later half of the nineteenth century.&nbsp;&nbsp;A sophisticated woman who is respectably married to a government bureaucrat, Anna begins a passionate, all-consuming involvement with a rich army officer.&nbsp;&nbsp;Refusing to conduct a discreet affair, she scandalizes society by abandoning both her husband and her young son for Count Vronsky--with tragic consequences.&nbsp;&nbsp;Running parallel is the story of the courtship and marriage of Konstantin Levin (the melancholy nobleman who is Tolstoy's stand-in) and Princess Kitty Shcherbatsky.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Levin's spiritual searching and growth reflect the religious ideals that at the time Tolstoy was evolving for himself.&nbsp;&nbsp;Taken together, the two plots embroider a vast canvas that ultimately encompasses all levels of Russian society.&nbsp;&nbsp;"Now and then Tolstoy's novel writes its own self, is produced by its matter, but its subject," noted Vladimir Nabokov.&nbsp;&nbsp;"<b>Anna Karenina</b> is one of the greatest love stories in world literature."&nbsp;&nbsp;As Matthew Arnold wrote in his celebrated essay on Tolstoy:&nbsp;&nbsp;"We are not to take <b>Anna Karenina</b> as a work of art; we are to take it as a piece of life."&nbsp;&nbsp;"Tolstoy is the greatest Russian writer of prose fiction....Tolstoy's prose keeps pace with our pulses, his characters seem to move with the same swing as the people passing under our window while we sit reading his book....No wonder, then, that elderly Russians at their evening tea talk of Tolstoy's characters as of people who really exist, people to whom their friends may be likened, people they see as distinctly as if they had danced with Kitty and Anna at that ball or dined with Oblonsky at his favorite restaurant, as we shall soon be dining with him. Readers call Tolstoy a giant not because other writers are dwarfs but because he remains always of exactly our own stature, exactly keeping pace with us instead of passing by in the distance, as other authors do." <br><br>--Vladimir Nabokov</p><h2>Taste Buds And Molecules: The Art and Science of Food, Wine, and Flavor</h2><p><b>"If Catalan superchef Ferran Adria is the leading missionary of molecular gastronomy, Mr. Chartier is his counterpart with a corkscrew."&#x2014;<i>Globe and Mail</i></b> <p>This award-winning book, now available for the first time in English in the U.S., presents a cutting-edge approach to food and wine pairing. Sommelier Francois Chartier has spent the better part of two decades collaborating with top scientists and chefs to map out the aromatic molecules that give foods and wines their flavor. Armed with the results of his extensive research, Chartier has been able to identify why certain foods and wines work well together at a molecular level. In this book, he has gathered his findings into a simple set of principles that explain how to create ideal harmonies in food and wine pairings. This new approach to the art and science of food and wine pairing will be an invaluable resource for sommeliers, chefs, and wine enthusiasts, as well as a fascinating read for anyone who is interested in the principles of modernist or "molecular" cuisine. The Canadian edition of Taste Buds and Molecules was a 2011 IACP Award nominee, and the original French-language edition, <i>Papilles et Molecules,</i> was named the Best Cookbook in the World in the category of Innovation at the 2010 Paris World Cookbook Awards, and also won the 2010 Gourmand Award for Canada for Best Design. The book includes a foreword by Juli Soler and Ferran Adria of El Bulli, who worked closely with Chartier in planning the menus at their renowned restaurant.</p></p><p><br><br> <b>Sample Pages from the Book (Click on images to enlarge)</b><br><br> <table> <tbody><tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr> <tr><td> </td> </tr> </tbody></table> <br><br><p>Of the five senses, it is perhaps taste that is the most deeply complex and rewarding. When aromatic flavors come together in perfect harmony, creating something greater than a simple mix of ingredients, we transcend the mundane and utilitarian act of eating and drinking to experience new and wonderful sensations.</p><p>Through centuries of trial and error, sommeliers and chefs have mastered the art of combining ingredients and pairing foods and wines to surprise and delight the palate, but few have seriously studied the science that makes these flavor harmonies possible. Without the mysterious and seemingly magical relationships between molecules and taste buds&#x2014;and between molecules and other molecules&#x2014;the flavors we love might be profoundly different. In Taste Buds and Molecules, master sommelier-researcher-cook Fran�ois Chartier explores the science of flavor to discover revolutionary new ideas and experiences. </p><p>As evidenced by the dishes he created in the legendary elBulli kitchen with Ferran Adri� and Juli Soler, Chartier exuberates in the unexpected and unexplained ways tastes and ingredients interact. Why do certain flavors form perfect harmonies? Why do thyme and lamb or rosemary and Riesling complement each other so well? Chartier reveals the answers here, helping you follow your own path to new flavor combinations and open new avenues to experimentation and delectation.</p><p>Beyond these fascinating and practical insights on food, flavors, and wine, Chartier also includes recipes and ideas that explore these flavor concepts, as well as illustrations, photos, and sketches that bring together the art of flavor and the science that underpins it. This is neither a simple guide to food and wine pairing nor a scientific textbook, but a body of knowledge designed to set the table for your own creative culinary endeavors, to further refine your tastes, and to take your cooking to new and extraordinary heights.</p></p><h2>Fear Street Super Thriller: Party Games &amp; Don't Stay Up Late</h2><p><p>In one volume, R.L.

Charts, yes. Sparkling prose, no.<br> <br> Except, that is, when it comes to Deirdre Nansen McCloskey. Her conversational and witty yet always clear style is a hallmark of her classic works of economic history, enlivening the dismal science and engaging readers well beyond the discipline. And now she&#x2019;s here to share the secrets of how it&#x2019;s done.<br> <br> <i>Economical Writing</i> is itself economical: a collection of thirty-five pithy rules for making your writing clear, concise, and effective. Proceeding from big-picture ideas to concrete strategies for improvement at the level of the paragraph, sentence, or word, McCloskey shows us that good writing, after all, is not just a matter of taste&#x2014;it&#x2019;s a product of adept intuition and a rigorous revision process. Debunking stale rules, warning us that &#x201c;footnotes are nests for pedants,&#x201d; and offering an arsenal of readily applicable tools and methods, she shows writers of all levels of experience how to rethink the way they approach their work, and gives them the knowledge to turn mediocre prose into magic.<br> <br> At once efficient and digestible, hilarious and provocative, <i>Economical Writing</i> lives up to its promise. With McCloskey as our guide, it&#x2019;s impossible not to see how any piece of writing&#x2014;on economics or any other subject&#x2014;can be a pleasure to read.</p></p><p><p><b>Deirdre N.

Among her many books are&nbsp;<i>The Bourgeois Virtues</i>,&nbsp;<i>Bourgeois Dignity</i>,&nbsp;<i>Bourgeois Equality</i>,<i>&nbsp;</i><i>Crossing: A Memoir</i>;&nbsp;<i>The Secret Sins of Economics</i>, and&nbsp;<i>If You&#x2019;re So Smart: The Narrative of Economic Expertise</i>, all published by the University of Chicago Press.</p>&nbsp;"You don&#x2019;t have to be an economist to benefit from the book, but it will certainly help many economists &#x2013; we are not famed for clarity and elegance of expression. . . . [McCloskey] is always a model of clarity. . . .&nbsp;Highly recommended for all who write as part of their work or for pleasure. Pretty much everybody?" (Diane Coyle <i>Enlightened Economist</i>)<br><br>"This slim volume should be required reading for all professionals and students, and its audience need not be limited to economists. . . . McCloskey has written a provocative book that has led me to re-think my own approach to writing. If more economists were to spend the short time necessary to read this book, both the writing and the reading of economics might become a more pleasurable experience." (<i>Southern Economic Journal</i>)<br><br>"If you want to be read (and who doesn't) and be remembered (better yet), <i>Economical Writing</i> is for you. This entertaining volume will teach you how to write meaningful and joyful economics. A dose of McCloskey banishes the dismal from the 'dismal science.' McCloskey is the Strunk and White of economics, and <i>Economical Writing </i>should be required reading for all economists." (Claudia Goldin, Harvard University)<br><br>"McCloskey has written the best short guide to academic prose in the language. Is this language English and not the Academic Official Style? Does McCloskey write with a sense that is also a sense of humor? All true. Buy and believe." (Richard Lanham, University of California, Los Angeles)<br><br>"McCloskey tells economists to say what they have to say clearly and economically, and then shows them how. Students can learn to write so that the professor will know what they mean and, more important, professors can learn to write so that the rest of the world will know what they mean." (Howard S. Becker, University of Washington)</p><h2>The War of the Worlds (Penguin Clothbound Classics)</h2><p><b>The first modern tale of alien invasion, H.G. Wells's The War of the Worlds remains one of the most influential science fiction novels ever published.</b><br><br>The night after a shooting star is seen streaking through the sky from Mars, a cylinder is discovered on Horsell Common in London. At first, na�ve locals approach the cylinder armed just with a white flag - only to be quickly killed by an all-destroying heat-ray, as terrifying tentacled invaders emerge. Soon the whole of human civilisation is under threat, as powerful Martians build gigantic killing machines, destroy all in their path with black gas and burning rays, and feast on the warm blood of trapped, still-living human prey. The forces of the Earth, however, may prove harder to beat than they at first appear. <i>The War of the Worlds </i>has been the subject of countless adaptations, including an Orson Welles radio drama which caused mass panic when it was broadcast, with listeners confusing it for a news broadcast heralding alien invasion; a musical version by Jeff Wayne; and, most recently, Steven Spielberg's 2005 film version, starring Tom Cruise. <br><br>This Penguin Classics edition includes a full biographical essay on Wells, a further reading list and detailed notes. The introduction, by Brian Aldiss, considers the novel's view of religion and society.&nbsp;<br><br>For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world.

Readers trust the series to provide authoritative texts enhanced by introductions and notes by distinguished scholars and contemporary authors, as well as up-to-date translations by award-winning translators.</p><p><b>H.G. Wells</b> was a professional writer and journalist, who published more than a hundred books, including novels, histories, essays and programmes for world regeneration. Wells's prophetic imagination was first displayed in pioneering works of science fiction, but later he became an apostle of socialism, science and progress. His controversial views on sexual equality and the shape of a truly developed nation remain directly relevant to our world today. He was, in Bertrand Russell's words, 'an important liberator of thought and action'. <br><br><b> Brian Aldiss</b> is a famed science fiction writer. Patrick Parrinder has written on H.G.

Featuring stunning pairings of more than 80 paintings and drawings, this book charts the evolution of Matisse&#x2019;s impact on Diebenkorn over the course of Diebenkorn&#x2019;s career. Though they never met, Matisse was an enduring source of inspiration for the Californian artist, and their works share surprising similarities in subject, composition, palette, and technique. Essays by Janet Bishop and Katherine Rothkopf explore how this influence evolved over time, connecting the work of the two painters and highlighting the ways Diebenkorn drew from Matisse&#x2019;s example to forge a style entirely his own. The volume is rounded out by an introduction by John Elderfield, who knew Diebenkorn personally and has curated exhibitions of both artists&#x2019; work; an essay by Jodi Roberts on parallels between the artists&#x2019; drawings; and a bibliography documenting Diebenkorn&#x2019;s collection of books about the French artist. The first in-depth examination of the relationship between the work of Diebenkorn and Matisse, this publication offers new ways of understanding both artists.</p><p>Janet Bishop is Thomas Weisel Family Curator of Painting and Sculpture at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art.<br><br>Katherine Rothkopf is Senior Curator of European Painting and Sculpture at the Baltimore Museum of Art.<br><br>John Elderfield is Chief Curator of Painting and Sculpture Emeritus at The Museum of Modern Art and the Allen R.

Her efforts to bring culture to the prairie village are met by a wall of gossip, greed, and petty small-minded bigotry. Lewis's complex and compelling work established him as an important character in American literature.This famous novel of life on Main Street, Gopher Prairie, mirrors with devastating honesty life on Main Streets from Albany to San Diego.</p><h2>Strunk&#39;s Source Readings in Music History: The Twentieth Century (Source Readings Vol. 7)</h2><p><p><strong>This book began as an attempt to carry out a suggestion made in 1929 by Carl Engel in his "Views and Reviews"-to fulfill his wish for " a living record of musical personalities, events, conditions, tastes ...a history of music faithfully and entirely carved from contemporary accounts.</strong></p> Twentieth-century music has been described as complex, vital, diverse, uncertain, experimental, self-conscious, innovative-the list is long and growing. Composers have been both credited with and accused of always searching for something "new," writing works that are mechanistic but romantic, meaningful but unskilled, beautiful but ugly! In <em>The Twentieth Century</em>, Robert P. Morgan helps us grasp the flavor of the era by presenting forty-five readings from the period, nearly all written by active participants in the musical developments of the time. Thus we tune in to the voices of some thirty composers-from Busoni to Babbitt, Ives to Xenakis, Satie to Stravinsky-and learn from performers Anderson and Landowska, philosopher-critics Adorno, Dahlhaus, and Meyer, and writers Cocteau, Barthes, and Eco.</p><p><p><strong>Leo Treitler</strong>, Distinguished Professor of Music at the City University of New York, is the author of <i>Music and the Historical Imagination</i>, as well as other books and articles on music historiography and medieval music.</p><p><strong>Robert P.

Patel explains what interfaith leadership is and explores the core competencies and skills of interfaith leadership, before turning to the issues interfaith leaders face and how they can prepare to solve them. Interfaith leaders seek points of connection and commonality&#x2014;in their neighborhoods, schools, college campuses, companies, organizations, hospitals, and other spaces where people of different faiths interact with one another. While it can be challenging to navigate the differences and disagreements that can arise from these interactions, skilled interfaith leaders are vital if we are to have a strong, religiously diverse democracy. This primer presents readers with the philosophical underpinnings of interfaith theory and outlines the skills necessary to practice interfaith leadership today.</p><p><b>Eboo Patel</b> is the founder and president of Interfaith Youth Core and the author of <i>Acts of Faith</i> and <i>Sacred Ground</i>. He was a member of President Obama&#x2019;s inaugural faith council, is a regular contributor to the <i>Washington Post</i>, <i>Huffington Post</i>, CNN, and public radio, and speaks frequently about interfaith cooperation on college campuses.

Accessible, inspiring, and rigorous, <i>Interfaith Leadership</i> will almost certainly become required reading in almost any class or workshop that engages religious diversity in our society today. Most of all, Patel has a keen eye for the stories that Americans have lived in trying to create and nurture that precious public space, where deeply held religious differences are neither ignored, nor dissolved, but woven into a common good.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;Laurie L. Patton, Professor of Religion, and President, Middlebury<br><br>&#x201c;At a time when Americans are fiercely debating differences over race, class and gender, Eboo Patel makes a compelling argument that to achieve healing, we must reconcile religious differences as well. Drawing upon practical stories as well as scholarly writings, he shows how we can move beyond diversity to an enriching pluralism. This is an important, insightful book by a man who has become a model of interfaith leadership.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;David Gergen, Professor of Public Service and Co-Director of the Center for Public Leadership at the Harvard Kennedy School</p><h2>How to Read Literature Like a Professor: A Lively and Entertaining Guide to Reading Between the Lines</h2><p><p>Thomas C.

By the 1980s many contended that these institutions--the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (now the World Trade Organization), the World Bank, and the International Monetary Fund--were threatened by growing economic nationalism in the United States, as demonstrated by increased trade protection and growing budget deficits.</p><br><p> In this book, Robert Gilpin argues that American power had been essential for establishing these institutions, and waning American support threatened the basis of postwar cooperation and the great prosperity of the period. For Gilpin, a great power such as the United States is essential to fostering international cooperation. Exploring the relationship between politics and economics first highlighted by Adam Smith, Karl Marx, and other thinkers of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, Gilpin demonstrated the close ties between politics and economics in international relations, outlining the key role played by the creative use of power in the support of an institutional framework that created a world economy.</p><br><p> Gilpin's exposition of the in.uence of politics on the international economy was a model of clarity, making the book the centerpiece of many courses in international political economy. At the beginning of the twenty-first century, when American support for international cooperation is once again in question, Gilpin's warnings about the risks of American unilateralism sound ever clearer.</p></p><p>This book is both a personal statement and a synthesis of certain recurrent and prevalent themes in the field of international political economy. Although I have endeavored to keep the personal and synthetic elements distinct from one another, I have presented my own views on selected questions of international political economy and have also incorporated those ideas and theories of others that are most relevant to the theses being developed.</p><h2>Introduction to Information Systems, Binder Ready Version</h2><p>The goal of<b><i>&nbsp;Introduction to Information Systems, Binder Ready Version, 6th Edition&nbsp;</i></b>is to teach all business majors, especially undergraduates, how to use information technology to master their current or future jobs and to help ensure the success of their organization.

From getting organized to putting the final touches on your prototype, all the information you need is right in the book. <br> <br> Inside, you'll learn about:<br> <ul> <li>Interaction design and physical computing</li> <li>The Arduino hardware and software development environment</li> <li>Basics of electricity and electronics</li> <li>Prototyping on a solderless breadboard</li> <li>Drawing a schematic diagram</li> </ul> And more. With inexpensive hardware and open-source software components that you can download free, getting started with Arduino is a snap. To use the introductory examples in this book, all you need is a USB Arduino, USB A-B cable, and an LED.<br> <br> Join the tens of thousands of hobbyists who have discovered this incredible (and educational) platform. Written by the co-founder of the Arduino project, with illustrations by Elisa Canducci, <em>Getting Started with Arduino</em> gets you in on the fun! This 128-page book is a greatly expanded follow-up to the author's original short PDF that's available on the Arduino website.</p><p><p> <i>Getting Started with Arduino</i>, authored by Arduino co-founder Massimo Banzi, offers a brief, fun, and lucid overview of Arduino that will appeal to lots of people who've been wanting to get into physical computing and want a way in.

To work with the introductory examples in this book, all you need is a USB Arduino, USB A-B cable, and an LED. </p> <strong>The Arduino Platform</strong> <br> Arduino is composed of two major parts: the Arduino board, which is the piece of hardware you work on when you build your objects; and the Arduino IDE, the piece of software you run on your computer. You use the IDE to create a sketch (a little computer program) that you upload to the Arduino board. The sketch tells the board what to do. <br> Not too long ago, working on hardware meant building circuits from scratch, using hundreds of different components with strange names like resistor, capacitor, inductor, transistor, and so on. <br> Every circuit was &#x201c;wired&#x201d; to do one specific application, and making changes required you to cut wires, solder connections, and more. <br> With the appearance of digital technologies and microprocessors, these functions, which were once implemented with wires, were replaced by software programs. <br> Software is easier to modify than hardware. With a few keypresses, you can radically change the logic of a device and try two or three versions in the same amount of time that it would take you to solder a couple of resistors. <br> <br> <strong>The Arduino Hardware</strong> <br> The Arduino board is a small microcontroller board, which is a small circuit (the board) that contains a whole computer on a small chip (the microcontroller). This computer is at least a thousand times less powerful than the MacBook I&#x2019;m using to write this, but it&#x2019;s a lot cheaper and very useful to build interesting devices. Look at the Arduino board: you&#x2019;ll see a black chip with 28 &#x201c;legs&#x201d;&#x2014;that chip is the ATmega168, the heart of your board. <br> We (the Arduino team) have placed on this board all the components that are required for this microcontroller to work properly and to communicate with your computer. There are many versions of this board; the one we&#x2019;ll use throughout this book is the Arduino Duemilanove, which is the simplest one to use and the best one for learning on. However, these instructions apply to earlier versions of the board, including the more recent Arduino Diecimila and the older Arduino NG.

This Penguin Shakespeare edition is edited by George Hunter with an introduction by Carol Rutter. &#39;By the pricking of my thumbs, Something wicked this way comes&#39; Promised a golden future as ruler of Scotland by three sinister witches, and spurred on by his wife, Macbeth murders King Duncan to ensure his ambitions come true. But he soon learns the meaning of terror - killing once, he must kill again and again, and the dead return to haunt him. A story of war, witchcraft and bloodshed, Macbeth also depicts the relationship between husbands and wives, and the risks they are prepared to take to achieve their desires. This book contains a general introduction to Shakespeare&#39;s life and Elizabethan theatre, a separate introduction to Macbeth, a chronology, suggestions for further reading, an essay discussing performance options on both stage and screen, and a commentary. William Shakespeare (1564-1616) was born to John Shakespeare and Mary Arden some time in late April 1564 in Stratford-upon-Avon. He wrote about 38 plays (the precise number is uncertain), many of which are regarded as the most exceptional works of drama ever produced, including Romeo and Juliet (1595), Henry V (1599), Hamlet (1601), Othello (1604), King Lear (1606) and Macbeth (1606), as well as a collection of 154 sonnets, which number among the most profound and influential love-poetry in English.

Classical buildings as widely spaced in time as a Roman temple, an Italian Renaissance palace and a Regency house all show an awareness of these rules even if they vary them, break them or poetically contradict them. Sir Christopher Wren described them as the "Latin" of architecture and the analogy is almost exact. There is the difference, however, that whereas the learning of Latin is a slow and difficult business, the language of classical architecture is relatively simple. It is still, to a great extent, the mode of expression of our urban surroundings, since classical architecture was the common language of the western world till comparatively recent times. Anybody to whom architecture makes a strong appeal has probably already discovered something of its grammar for himself. </p><p>In this book, the author's purpose is to set out as simply and vividly as possible the exact grammatical workings of this architectural language. He is less concerned with its development in Greece and Rome than with its expansion and use in the centuries since the Renaissance. He explains the vigorous discipline of "the orders" and the scope of "rustication"; the dramatic deviations of the Baroque and, in the last chapter, the relationship between the classical tradition and the "modern" architecture of today. The book is intended for anybody who cares for architecture but more specifically for students beginning a course in the history of architecture, to whom a guide to the classical rules will be an essential companion.</p></p><p><b>John Summerson</b>&nbsp;(25 November 1904 &#x2013; 10 November 1992) was one of the leading British architectural historians of the 20th century.</p><h2>Introduction to Magic, Volume II: The Path of Initiatic Wisdom</h2><p>Authentic initiatic practices, rituals, and wisdom collected by the UR Group <br><br>� Shares a rigorous selection of initiatory exercises, including instructions for creating the diaphanous body of the <i>Opus magicum</i>, establishing initiatic consciousness after death, and the construction of magical chains (the enchained awareness of initiates) <br><br>� Offers studies of mystery traditions throughout history, presenting not only the principles themselves but also witnesses to them and their continual validity today <br><br>The &#x201c;Gruppo di UR&#x201d; was a group of Italian esotericists who collaborated from 1927 to 1929. The purpose of this group was to study and practice ancient rituals gleaned from the mystery traditions of the world, both East and West, in order to attain a state of superhuman consciousness and power to allow them to act magically on the world. They produced a monthly journal containing techniques for spiritual realization, accounts of personal experiences, translations of ancient texts, and original essays on esoteric topics. The group included a distinguished line-up of occultists, neo-pagans, freemasons, Anthroposophists, orientalists, poets, and members of high society. The prime movers of the group were Arturo Reghini (1878-1946), a Pythagorean mathematician and reviver of a spiritual Freemasonry, and Julius Evola (1898-1974), then a young philosopher with a precocious mastery of the esoteric doctrines of East and West. Many years later, in 1971, Evola gathered these essays into three volumes. Inner Traditions published Volume I in 2001, under the title <i>Introduction to Magic: Rituals and Practical Techniques for the Magus</i>. <br><br>This volume, the second in the series, complements the first one, yet they are not strictly sequential, and their contents can be read in any order. Volume II shares authentic initiatic wisdom and a rigorous selection of initiatory exercises, including instructions for creating the diaphanous body of the <i>Opus magicum</i>, establishing initiatic consciousness after death, and the construction of magical chains (the enchained awareness of initiates). It offers studies of mystery traditions throughout history, presenting not only the principles themselves but also witnesses to them and their continual validity today. <br><br>This series shows that the &#x201c;Magic&#x201d; of the UR Group meant an active and affirmative attitude toward individual development, handed down from a &#x201c;primordial tradition&#x201d; and discernable in alchemy, Hermetism, esoteric religious doctrines, indigenous practices, Tantra, Taoism, Buddhism, Vedanta, and the pagan mysteries of the West. Although some of the practical experiments demanded extraordinary efforts, both individual and collective, there is incalculable value here even for the less heroic, for merely reading these essays leaves a permanent mark on the reader.</p><p>A controversial philosopher and critic of modern Western civilization, Julius Evola (1898-1974) wrote widely on Eastern religions, alchemy, sexuality, politics, and mythology. Inner Traditions has published his <i>Eros and the Mysteries of Love: The Metaphysics of Sex</i>, <i>The Yoga of Power</i>, <i>The Hermetic Tradition</i>, <i>Revolt Against the Modern World,</i> <i>The Mystery of the Grail </i>and <i>Ride The Tiger</i>.<br><br>Joscelyn Godwin was born in Kelmscott, Oxfordshire, England on January 16, 1945. He was educated as a chorister at Christ Church Cathedral School, Oxford, then at Radley College (Music Scholar), and Magdalene College, Cambridge (Music Scholar; B.A., 1965, Mus. B., 1966, M.A. 1969). Coming to the USA in 1966, he did graduate work in Musicology at Cornell University (Ph. D., 1969; dissertation: "The Music of Henry Cowell") and taught at Cleveland State University for two years before joining the Colgate University Music Department in 1971. He has taught at Colgate ever since.Chapter II.1 <br><br>Instructions for Magical Chains <br><br>The following instructions concern those students of esoteric science who, having found among themselves sufficient spiritual affinity and seriousness of intention, wish to organize a chain that will eventually be able to contact other chains, created on the same principles by other groups and in other places. <br><br>We presume that a chain set up in this manner has an essentially initiatic purpose. Thus above all else and any incidental intention, it aims to promote and develop realization of a spiritual type suitable to each member. Such a chain will be marked by particular types of activity, awareness, and individuality. In some kinds of chain the individuals are simply thrown together, and the polarity of masculine and feminine necessary for operations is not reflected harmoniously in every member. Instead, they separate into the opposition of the fluid, passive mass formed by the majority, and the active role of a leader. But in the type of chain proposed here, every member must distinctly and firmly possess self-awareness, control, and mastery: thus both aspects of the Hermetic complementarity. Each must participate in the chain as an <i>individual</i>, as a distinct force. The chain formed by such <i>individuals</i> will become compact and positive in every way when, through repeated meetings, the various distinct elements become attuned and form a unity. <br><br>Following this intention, every group will cohere by means of an essentially dynamic symbol such as the <i>pentagram</i>, which will be cast <i>projectively</i>, i.e. from right to left. The <i>emissive</i> way of drawing (from left to right) is limited to the symbol of the circle, to be drawn before the pentagram not so much for insulation as for accumulating the individuals&#x2019; energies. <br><br>For the same reason, unlike what might suit a purely ceremonial magic, one does not rely simply on the strength of the collective ritual and of quasi-automatic elements (<i>ex opere operato</i>). On the contrary, this requires that for a good while, both before and during the meetings, the members should work energetically on themselves, with their own energies, so that they can contribute actively to the firm structure of the chain. <br><br>We will begin by outlining the discipline that the members chosen by the group leaders must observe individually, uninterruptedly, with firmness, intelligence, and zeal. These are mostly exercises already described in the first volume of this collection, but which we will now organize as a daily program. One must persevere at them until one feels their result in an abandonment of the usual, lethargic attitude toward things and toward oneself, which is the chief obstacle to initiatic realization.<br><br>INDIVIDUAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR PREPARATION <br><br>Aimed at the following goals: <br><br>1) Awakening a greater <i>intelligence toward natural phenomena</i>, so that the sense of life extends rhythmically beyond oneself. We will dwell for now on the basic phenomenon of the <i>succession of day and night</i>. <br><br>2) Training the mind in <i>dynamic concentration</i>, consisting in the tracing and projection of figures and symbols inside oneself. <br><br>3) Training the spirit in <i>fixity</i>. <br><br>4) Strengthening in the course of daily life the sense of the <i>continuity</i> and <i>presence</i> of oneself. <br><br>1) For the first point, practice the contemplations before sleeping and immediately on waking, with the symbols of the &#x201c;sun&#x201d; and the &#x201c;mountain.&#x201d; Where the outer light declines, the inner light arises. In the evening, before sleep, in a calm mood, not exhausted in body and especially not in mind (the habit of taking a bath before bed is a useful restorative), visualize a slow sunrise while you see and feel yourself climbing a mountain, up to an imaginary midday peak corresponding to the depth of night in the physical world. Then fix this idea: &#x201c;I AM THE LIGHT.&#x201d; Accustom yourself to sinking into sleep with the mind on the one idea of the nocturnal sun at its zenith, calmly refusing every other thought or image that may arise. <br><br>In the morning, free the mind from any residual sleepiness, then re-evoke the nocturnal sun at the zenith where you left it, and imagine that it is going down, while you yourself descend from the peak. The dawning of the physical sun and the awakening in the physical body mark the moment of return to this world of darkness, from which you took leave last night, with the nocturnal light. Nonetheless, evoke the sense of this nonphysical and invisible light, and while trying to retain it, say: &#x201c;THE LIGHT IS IN ME.&#x201d; Carry that as the very meaning of being awake, aware, and active as an individual among external things. Feel that the light in your own soul<i> is stronger than the external light</i>. This sense increases until midday, then declines in the evening, when you retreat from that battle position which is our life as humans, and reenter the world of light. <br><br>These contemplations must become <i>alive</i>. If not, <i>they are fruitless</i>. They should lead to an awareness of day and night; to a sort of <i>subtle sensitivity to the various hours</i>; to perceiving a rhythm in which the inner and the outer meet. Do not suppose that this demands a special kind of life removed from normal occupations. The purpose is all the better served when the discipline is not kept separate from those but succeeds in affirming itself in the thick of everyday life. No one, however busy during the day, lacks moments of pause when his thoughts wander at random or dwell on his concerns. These moments can be used instead for recollection to higher consciousness: for example, for <i>feeling</i> the present time of day and paying attention to the sense of the &#x201c;hour,&#x201d; to the degree of light of one&#x2019;s own consciousness and one&#x2019;s own energy.</p><h2>Alchi: Treasure of the Himalayas</h2><p>The world-famous Buddhist monastery of Alchi in Ladakh, India, is the best-preserved temple complex in the Himalayas. Proposed for inclusion in the UNESCO World Cultural Heritage list in 1998, the monastery&#x2019;s artworks reveal influences from India and Tibet across Central Asia and Iran, even as far back as Ancient Greece.&nbsp; Housing thousands of rare paintings and sculptures from the area dating back to the eleventh century, it provides fascinating insight into the spiritual and secular life of medieval Kashmir and Western Tibet.<br> The Dalai Lama has authorized the publication of images of these Buddhist masterpieces for the first and only time. Beautifully photographed by Peter van Ham, the images in this volume capture the miniaturesque delicacy and broad range of color of these precious works. With essays by renowned Tibetologist Amy Heller, and a foreward by His Holiness the Dalai Lama himself, this once-in-a-lifetime volume offers fascinating new insights&#x2014;including a large panorama double gate fold&#x2014;into one of the most beautiful monasteries in the Himalayas.</p><p><b>Peter van Ham</b> is a Frankfurt-based author and photographer who has been researching Himalayan culture for nearly thirty years. He is the author of <i>Guge</i> and <i>Tabo</i>, both also published by Hirmer Publishers.One of the finest art books ever produced. . . . Working in extremely challenging conditions, particularly in the narrow, almost unreachable second and third stories of the Sumtsek, van Ham put together a masterpiece. The true achievement, however, lies not merely in the completeness of the photographic record but&#x2014;as with his previous books&#x2014;in his ability to convey the interlacing layers of light and shadow, the uneven textures of surface and color, and the emotional punch these images from a thousand years ago are still able to deliver, even to a viewer who knows nothing of Buddhist iconography and ritual practice. . . . At the heart of van Ham&#x2019;s artistic enterprise is his uncanny gift for showing us, in the paintings he has photographed, this continuous, ravishing evanescence. Once one takes in this truth of transience and sees, with open eyes, its logic and inherent wonder, the most remarkable feeling of freedom and happiness sets in.&#x201d;&nbsp; (David Shulman <i>New York Review Daily</i>)</p><h2>Understanding Applied Behavior Analysis: An Introduction to ABA for Parents, Teachers, and Other Professionals</h2><p><p>Understanding applied behaviour analysis is a book that I have been waiting for, for quite some time.

Providing access to the unity of structure and function in the organism, such therapy offers a simple, direct, and non-dogmatic means for tapping the body&#x2019;s inherent intelligence in a fluid and spontaneous way. We should not presume that the techniques in this book deal solely with the bones of the cranium, the spine, and the lower back. The craniosacral system is no less than the structural aspect of the central nervous system. Its methods originate in neural behavior and emotional energy and include their manifestations throughout the tissues and organs of the body. Both a medical system with precise anatomical criteria and a therapeutic art requiring a practitioner to feel, interpret, and move energy, modern craniosacral therapy offers a unique way to perceive and influence the structural configuration of the brain itself in its relationship to the body&#x2019;s architecture.</p><p>Don Cohen, D.C., is a graduate of Palmer College of Chiropractic West and of the Upledger Institute. Since 1982 he has practiced chiropractic and craniosacral therapy in Santa Cruz, California, where he is co-director (with his wife Karen, a homeopath and chiropractor) of the Branciforte Clnic. Since 1985 he has been engaged in clinical research into the nature of neurologic adaptation strategy to musculoskeletal injury, chronic pain, and degeneration syndromes."Don Cohen has done an excellent job of presenting an overview of the various diagnostic, evaluative, and therapeutic approaches to the cranium, the sacrum, the dura matter envelope, and the fluid which it encloses. He is one of those rare individuals who has a real and true sense of the human body and what it is about. He also has a deep appreciation of the fact that the human body is not living in isolation.

Reinhart begins with a broad jungle scene for baby Mowgli's rescue from Shere Khan. He sets the lad's rescue from the monkeys against a towering ruin; takes him to the treasure chambers where White Cobra lurks behind a flap; pairs his first encounter with humans to a startling, savage leaping tiger; shows him enlisting a herd of elephants to destroy the village; and finishes with his farewell to a reunion of downcast animal friends on craggy Council Rock. Along with smaller pop-ups, the text is tucked beneath flaps in one or two corners of each scene. That text has been dramatically shortened, but Reinhart preserves at least vestiges of the original's stately language. Along with being a natural centerpiece for displays, this book provides a memorable introduction to both the film and the full-length literary work.<i>&#x2013;John Peters, New York Public Library</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Their work is a blend of traditional and contemporary techniques, using ink or graphite mixed with digital. The Night Gardener is their first book.

They are represented by Kirsten Hall, at Catbird Agency.PreS-Gr 3&#x2014;The Fan brothers' elegant illustrations and understated yet emotion-packed storytelling create a picture book that is at once mystical, magical, and magnetic. Finn, a boy of Asian descent who lives by the sea, remembers the stories his grandfather told him about a faraway place "where ocean meets sky." Today would have been Grandpa's 90th birthday, and Finn honors him by building a boat for the journey they had planned together. After cobbling together driftwood, an old tire, window frames, and other discarded materials, he crawls inside the vessel for a short nap. When he awakens, the boat is at sea; but this is no ordinary voyage. A massive golden fish with a mustache and goatee agrees to lead Finn to the destination described in his grandfather's tales. After visiting several amazing locales (including the Library Islands, where "bookish birds" roost and read), the boat lifts skyward ("or had the water fallen away?"). Finn glides through eye-catching spreads filled with wonders from ocean and air (a magnificent m�lange of giant whales, submarines, sailing ships, dirigibles, hot air balloons, and more) toward a full moon with a very familiar and much-longed-for face. Summoned home by his mother's call, Finn stands on the seashore, looks to the moon, and acknowledges that "It had been a good day for sailing." Rendered in graphite and colored digitally, the artwork masterfully blends realistic details with soaring flights of fancy.

Readers learn how to simply yet deliciously cook rice, the jewel of Persian cooking, which, when combined with a little meat, fowl, or fish, vegetables, fruits, and herbs, provides the perfect balanced diet. </p> <p><b>ABOUT THE BOOK'S TITLE<br> <i>Food of Life,</i></b> the title of the book, comes from the Persian words <i>nush-e jan,</i> literally "food of life"--a traditional wish in Iran that a dish will be enjoyed. For the updated 1993 edition the title was changed to <i>New Food of Life.</i> Now, for the 25th anniversary edition the title returns to its original name, <i>Food of Life.</i> </p><p><b>The full-color <i>Food of Life 25</i><i>th</i><i> Anniversary Edition</i> contains 50% more pages than its 2009 predecessor and special added features:</b><br> *New Recipes adapted from Sixteenth-Century Persian cookbooks <br> *Added vegetarian section for most recipes <br> *Comprehensive dictionary of all ingredients <br> *A glance at a few thousand years of the history of Persian Cooking <br> *Master recipes with photos illustrating the steps. <br> *Color photos of most recipes with tips on presentation <br> *Updated section on Persian stores and Internet suppliers <br> *Fahrenheit and Centigrade temperatures for all recipes <br> *Choices for cooking recipes such as kuku in oven or on stovetop. <br> *Encourages use of seasonal and local ingredients from farmers markets, Community Supported Agriculture (CSAs) sources or one's own backyard</p></p><p>Cooking plays important roles in every culture, but Persian cuisine can claim a relationship to its native land that is uniquely deep and intricate. This book celebrates the central place of food in the life of Iran, a story extending back almost 4,000 years, when recipes were first recorded in a cuneiform script on clay tablets. At the same time, Food of Life--updated and expanded in this new edition--is designed to be used by today's cook. It provides a veritable treasury of recipes: 330 in all, presented in an easy to-follow format, along with standard variations and, in many cases, a vegetarian version. The title of the book comes from the words nush-e jan, literally "food of life"--a traditional wish in Iran that a dish will be enjoyed.<p> Along with daily gifts of pleasure, Persian cooking has figured intimately in numerous Iranian festivals and ceremonies. The menus and recipes associated with such events are described in Food of Life in detail, from the winter solstice celebration, Shab-e Yalda, or the "sun's birthday eve," to the rituals and symbolism involved in a modern Iranian marriage. Also woven through this book are many examples of how food has inspired artists, poets, and other luminaries of Persian culture. The book includes the miniatures of Mir Mosavvar and Aqa Mirak; excerpts from such classics as the fourth-century tale Khosrow and His Knight, the tenth-century Book of Kings, and the Thousand and One Nights; poems by Omar Khayyam, Rumi, and Sohrab Sepehri; and the humor of Mulla Nasruddin. </p><p> Even as it honors venerable traditions and centuries of artistic expression, Food of Life propels Persian cooking into the twenty-first century. Today, with most of the ingredients in this book's recipes readily available throughout the U.S., anyone can reproduce the refined tastes, textures, and beauty of this great cuisine-- ancient, and also timeless.</p><b>NAJMIEH BATMANGLIJ</b>, hailed as "the guru of Persian cuisine" by <i>The Washington Post</i>, has spent the past 30 years cooking, traveling, and adapting authentic Persian recipes to tastes and techniques in the West.

The book describes how humans are the only species to cook their food, and it includes a fascinating time line relating when various items common today entered the human diet, artfully arousing curiosity about what we eat every day (for instance, cocoa was introduced in 1900 BCE, pizza in 1,000 CE, and coffee and potatoes in the 16th century). Illustrated discussions of how food supports the body's building blocks and fuels them are fascinating, while comparisons of nutrition guidelines in the United Kingdom and the United States indicate there is no one answer to how much is enough. Viewers will appreciate a dramatic graphic that analyzes a fast food hamburger. Enticing quizzes may spark further discussion. A strong glossary and index are appended. Students doing reports will find much content, but they will need to read carefully to understand the interrelationships.

Eli had come home to Bluff House, his grandmother&#x2019;s home on Whiskey Beach, to put his life back together. Although he had been cleared of murdering his wife, Lindsay, in Boston over a year ago, some people still believe that where there is smoke, there is fire. All Eli wants to do is get away and put in some serious time working on his novel. But when he arrives at Bluff House, he discovers his grandmother has asked her neighbor, housecleaner/yoga instructor/jewelry maker/massage therapist Abra Walsh, not only to take care of her house, but also to look after Eli. Eli attempts to keep Abra at arm&#x2019;s length, but she gradually wears down his resistance with her home-cooked meals and kind words. What&#x2019;s more, Abra firmly believes Eli is innocent, and, with her help, Eli sets out to finally clear his name, and not only for himself. With its compelling characters and irresistible plot, this is a perfect synthesis of romance and suspense, guaranteed to keep Roberts&#x2019; fans up long past their bedtimes.

She says she first knew she wanted to become a writer at the age of nine, when she had a poem published in a local newspaper. <i>The Tail of Emily Windsnap</i>, her first children&#x2019;s book, grew out of a poem she wrote about a mermaid.As I swam around the rocks at the end of the bay, the water became clearer and softer. It was like switching from grainy black-and-white film into color. The fat gray fish were replaced by stripy yellow-and-blue ones with floppy silver tails, long thin green ones with spiky antennae and angry mouths, orange ones with spotted black fins&#x2014;-all darting purposefully around me. <br><br>Every now and then, I swam across a shallow sandy stretch. Wispy little sticklike creatures as thin as paper wriggled along beneath me, almost see-through against the sand. Then the water would suddenly get colder and deeper as I went over a rocky part. I swished myself across these carefully. They were covered in prickly black sea urchins, and I wouldn&#x2019;t be thrilled to get one of those stuck on my tail.<br><br>Soon the water got warmer again as I came to another shallow part. I was getting tired. I came up for fresh air and realized I was miles from home; farther away than I&#x2019;d ever been on my own. I tried to flick myself along, but my tail flapped lazily and started to ache. Eventually, I made it to a big, smooth rock with a low shelf. I pulled myself out of the water, my tail resting on some pebbles in the sea. A minute later, it went numb. I wiggled my toes and shivered as I watched my legs come back. That part was still really creepy!<br><br>Sitting back against a larger rock, I caught my breath. Then I heard something. Like singing, but without words. The wet rocks shimmered in the moonlight, but there was no one around. Had I imagined it? The water lapped against the pebbles, making them jangle as it sucked its breath away from the shore. There it was again&#x2014;-the singing.<br><br>Where was it coming from? I clambered up a jagged rock and looked down the other side. That&#x2019;s when I saw her. I rubbed my eyes. Surely it couldn&#x2019;t be . . . but it was! It was a mermaid! A real one! <br><br>The kind you read about in kids&#x2019; stories. Long blond hair all the way down her back, which she was brushing while she sang. She was perched on the edge of a rock, shuffling a bit as though she were trying to get comfortable. Her tail was longer and thinner than mine. Silvery green and shimmering in the moonlight, it flapped against the rock as she sang. <br><br>She kept singing the same song. When she got to the end, she started again. A couple of times, she was in the middle of a really high part when she stopped and hit her tail with the brush. "Come on, Shona," she said sharply. "Get it right!"<br><br>I stared for ages, opening and closing my mouth like a fish. I wanted to talk to her. But what exactly do you say to a singing mermaid perched on a rock in the middle of the night? Funnily enough, I&#x2019;ve never had that come up before. <br><br>In the end, I coughed gently and she looked up immediately.<br><br>"Oh!" she said. She gaped open-mouthed at my legs for a second. And then, with a twist and a splash, she was gone.</p><h2>The Gunslinger(The Dark Tower I)</h2><p><b>Now a major motion picture starring Matthew McConaughey and Idris Elba</b><br> <br> &#x201c;An impressive work of mythic magnitude that may turn out to be Stephen King&#x2019;s greatest literary achievement&#x201d; (<i>The Atlanta Journal-Constitution</i>), <i>The Gunslinger</i> is the first volume in the epic Dark Tower Series.<br><br>A #1 national bestseller, <i>The Gunslinger</i> introduces readers to one of Stephen King&#x2019;s most powerful creations, Roland of Gilead: The Last Gunslinger. He is a haunting figure, a loner on a spellbinding journey into good and evil. In his desolate world, which mirrors our own in frightening ways, Roland tracks The Man in Black, encounters an enticing woman named Alice, and begins a friendship with the boy from New York named Jake.<br> <br>Inspired in part by the Robert Browning narrative poem, &#x201c;Childe Roland to the Dark Tower Came,&#x201d; <i>The Gunslinger</i> is &#x201c;a compelling whirlpool of a story that draws one irretrievable to its center&#x201d; (<i>Milwaukee Sentinel</i>). It is &#x201c;brilliant and fresh...and will leave you panting for more&#x201d; (<i>Booklist</i>).</p><p>Thirty-three years, a horrific and life-altering accident, and thousands of desperately rabid fans in the making, Stephen King's quest to complete his magnum opus rivals the quest of Roland and his band of gunslingers who inhabit the Dark Tower series. Loyal DT fans and new readers alike will appreciate this revised edition of <i>The Gunslinger</i>, which breathes new life into Roland of Gilead, and offers readers a "clearer start and slightly easier entry into Roland's world."<p> King writes both a new introduction and foreword to this revised edition, and the ever-patient, ever-loyal "constant reader" is rewarded with secrets to the series's inception. That a "magic" ream of green paper and a Robert Browning poem, came together to reveal to King his "ka" is no real surprise (this is King after all), but who would have thought that the squinty-eyed trio of Clint Eastwood, Lee Van Cleef, and Eli Wallach would set the author on his true path to the Tower? While King credits Tolkien for inspiring the "quest and magic" that pervades the series, it was Sergio Leone's <i>The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly</i> that helped create the epic proportions and "almost absurdly majestic western backdrop" of Roland's world.</p><p> To King, <i>The Gunslinger</i> demanded revision because once the series was complete it became obvious that "the beginning was out of sync with the ending." While the revision adds only 35 pages, Dark Tower purists will notice the changes to Allie's fate and Roland's interaction with Cort, Jake, and the Man in Black--all stellar scenes that will reignite the hunger for the rest of the series. Newcomers will appreciate the details and insight into Roland's life. The revised Roland of Gilead (nee Deschain) is embodied with more humanity--he loves, he pities, he regrets. What DT fans might miss is the same ambiguity and mystery of the original that gave the original its pulpy underground feel (back when King himself awaited word from Roland's world). <i>--Daphne Durham</i></p>Stephen King is the author of more than sixty books, all of them worldwide bestsellers.&nbsp;His recent work includes&nbsp;<i>The Institute</i>, <i>Elevation</i>, <i>The Outsider</i>,&nbsp;<i>Sleeping Beauties</i>&nbsp;(cowritten with his son Owen King), and the Bill Hodges trilogy:&nbsp;<i>End of Watch</i>,&nbsp;<i>Finders&nbsp;Keepers</i>,&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>Mr. Mercedes</i>&nbsp;(an Edgar Award winner&nbsp;for Best Novel and an AT&amp;T Audience Network original television series).

Yoga has the power of transformation. Not only does it strengthen bodies and calm minds, but with a little imagination, it can show us that anything is possible. <i>New York Times</i> bestselling illustrator Peter H.

Kevin and his wife, Trisha, have&nbsp;eight children.</p><p>Senior Pastor,&nbsp;Christ Covenant Church, Matthews, North Carolina</p><p>&#x201c;This book is vintage DeYoung&#x2014;ruthlessly biblical.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;<strong>John Piper</strong><strong>,</strong>&nbsp;Founder, desiringGod.org; Chancellor, Bethlehem College and Seminary</p><p>&#x201c;My heart resonated deeply when I first heard Kevin speak on this subject. His message is a wake-up call to God&#x2019;s people&#x2014;timely, prophetic, and desperately needed in our day. As a gifted theologian and thinker, Kevin tackles many of the biblical intricacies and nuances of true holiness. As a pastor, he evidences sincere compassion and concern for the condition of the flock. As a fellow pilgrim, he gets to the heart of ways of thinking and living that keep us from reflecting our holy God in this dark world. As a servant and lover of Christ, he holds out a vision of the beauty and power of personal holiness.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;<strong>Nancy Leigh DeMoss</strong><strong>,</strong> author<em></em>; radio host, <em>Revive Our Hearts</em></p><p>&#x201c;Holiness was once a central component of following Christ. But for many today, the Christian life is little more than a celebration of cheap grace and pseudo-liberty, with a high tolerance for sin. In this well-written and much-needed book, Kevin DeYoung thoughtfully points us to an unpopular yet strangely liberating truth&#x2014;that God is holy and expects <em>us</em> to be holy. With no hint of legalism or drudgery, Kevin offers a balanced and engaging view of law and grace. Kevin DeYoung is one of my favorite writers, and this book demonstrates why. I repeatedly said 'Yes!&#x2019; as I turned these pages. I&#x2019;m convinced that Christ-followers desperately need to read, discuss, and live out the timely, God-exalting message of <em>The Hole in Our Holiness!</em>&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;<strong>Randy Alcorn</strong><strong>,</strong> Founder and Director, Eternal Perspective Ministries; author, <em>If God Is Good</em> and <em>Heaven</em></p><p>&#x201c;Grace is too amazing to save us from sin&#x2019;s guilt only to leave us under its cruel tyranny. In this book, Kevin DeYoung reminds us that the gospel is the ground of our justification and sanctification. At the same time, he reminds us of the many exhortations in Scripture to pursue godliness as the fruit of our union with Christ in the power of the Spirit. <em>The Hole in Our Holiness</em> offers important reflections on a crucial topic in the ongoing conversation about the joys and struggles of the Christian life.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;<strong>Michael Horton</strong><strong>,</strong> J. Gresham Machen Professor of Systematic Theology and Apologetics, Westminster Seminary California; author, <em>Calvin on the Christian Life</em></p><p>&#x201c;One might expect a book about holiness to be heavy on finger-pointing, leaning toward legalism, and embarrassingly out-of-touch. But <em>The Hole in Our Holiness</em> is none of those things. Instead, Kevin DeYoung gets specific about what Spirit-infused, gospel-driven effort toward holiness looks like. Going way past &#x2018;try harder&#x2019; and &#x2018;believe better,&#x2019; this book implants in readers not just a longing to be holy but real hope that it could happen.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;<strong>Nancy Guthrie</strong><strong>,</strong> Bible Teacher; author, Seeing Jesus in the Old Testament Bible study series</p><p>&#x201c;J. C. Ryle wrote his classic <em>Holiness</em> out of a concern that &#x2018;practical holiness and entire consecration to God are not sufficiently attended to by modern Christians in this country.&#x2019; It is with the same prescient concern and pastoral insight that my friend Kevin DeYoung has written what I consider to be the modern equivalent, urging a new generation of Christians to obey God's command to &#x2018;be holy, for I am holy.&#x2019; May <em>The Hole in Our Holiness</em> do for our time what <em>Holiness</em> did in a previous age: promote gospel-centered holiness in Christians and churches around the world.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;<strong>C. J. Mahaney</strong><strong>,</strong> Senior Pastor, Sovereign Grace Church of Louisville, Louisville, Kentucky</p><p>&#x201c;I have loved being under Kevin's teaching during my college years, specifically on this matter of holiness. This is indispensable reading material for all who desire a life of piety. Though we are fallen people, Kevin points us to our potential for godliness and how our progress in this area is of the utmost importance. Get your highlighter ready!&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;<strong>Kirk Cousins</strong><strong>, </strong>former starting quarterback, Michigan State University; quarterback, Washington Redskins</p><p>&#x201c;The strength of this book lies in its biblical understanding that all great renewal is founded upon knowing the goodness and holiness of God. We are commanded to be holy because he is holy, and only in Christ can we be trained accordingly: &#x2018;For the grace of God has appeared bringing salvation to all people, training us to renounce ungodliness and worldly passions, and to live self-controlled, upright, and godly lives in the present age&#x2019; (Titus 2:11). I pray that Kevin&#x2019;s words would be read widely and that the church might be known as a people &#x2018;zealous for good works&#x2019; upon seeing the Father&#x2019;s holiness and Christ&#x2019;s redeeming work.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;<strong>John M.

But after her first visit, Dr. Awdish spent months fighting for her life, enduring consecutive major surgeries and experiencing multiple overlapping organ failures. At each step of the recovery process, Awdish was faced with something even more unexpected: repeated cavalier behavior from her fellow physicians&#x2015;indifference following human loss, disregard for anguish and suffering, and an exacting emotional distance. </p><p>Hauntingly perceptive and beautifully written, <i>In Shock</i> allows the reader to transform alongside Awidsh and watch what she discovers in our carefully-cultivated, yet often misguided, standard of care. Awdish comes to understand the fatal flaws in her profession and in her own past actions as a physician while achieving, through unflinching presence, a crystalline vision of a new and better possibility for us all. </p><p>As Dr. Awdish finds herself up against the same self-protective partitions she was trained to construct as a medical student and physician, she artfully illuminates the dysfunction of disconnection. Shatteringly personal, and yet wholly universal, she offers a brave road map for anyone navigating illness while presenting physicians with a new paradigm and rationale for embracing the emotional bond between doctor and patient.</p></p><p>DR. RANA AWDISH is the Director of the Pulmonary Hypertension Program at Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit and a Critical Care Physician. She was recently named Medical Director of Care Experience for the ($6 billion, 24,000 employee) Health System. She was awarded the Speak-Up Hero award in 2014 for her work on improving communication, as well as the Critical Care Teaching Award in 2016. In 2017 she was a finalist for the Schwartz Center&#x2019;s 2017 National Compassionate Caregiver of the Year (NCCY) Award and the Physician of the Year award from the Press Ganey National Client Conference. Dr. Awdish is board-certified in Internal Medicine, Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine.<p>"Awdish's book is the one I wished we were given as assigned reading our first year of medical school, alongside our white coats and stethoscopes...dramatic, engaging and instructive." &#x2015;<i>The New York Times Book Review</i></p><p>&#x201c;Awdish's story is grueling: a catastrophic miscarriage, multiple organ failure, the uncertainty that accompanies a sudden medical crisis. <i>In Shock</i> searches for a glimmer of hope in life&#x2019;s darkest moments, and finds it.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>The Washington Post</i></p><p>"In a gut-wrenching memoir approaching Job-level suffering, Awdish recounts her ordeal as a doctor-turned-patient and the many changes in her perspective and practice of medicine...Awdish&#x2019;s emotional tenor is electric (and understandable): angry, anxious, self-pitying, vulnerable, even terrified. But she&#x2019;s also heroic, smart, and determined.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Booklist</i> (starred review)</p><p>"<i>In Shock</i> should be required reading in every medical, nursing and health professional school. Dr. Awdish cuts to the core of what is ailing the healthcare system: a loss of humanity. Her honest and poignant appraisal of how modern medicine systematizes illness and suffering is a wake up call to rethink medical pedagogy and the concept of how we truly heal. Ultimately, she gives us hope that through better understanding of each other and ourselves, we can reinvigorate the human connection at the heart of healthcare." &#x2015;Andrew J. Shin, JD, MPH, Senior Director, Policy, The Schwartz Center for Compassionate Healthcare</p><p>"A compassionate and critical look at medicine and illness from both a doctor&#x2019;s and a patient&#x2019;s perspective...Awdish has written a unique and insightful memoir." &#x2015;<i>Publishers Weekly</i></p><p>"A sobering, well-rendered reality check on the desperate need for advanced training on compassion-centric modes of patient care." &#x2015;<i>Kirkus Reviews</i></p><p>"Dr. Rana Awdish brings the much-needed voice of the patient to life in a courageous retelling of her catastrophic illness and stunning revelations of the major disconnect between the communication caregivers deliver and what patients need. Rana&#x2019;s story is not only compelling; it&#x2019;s a call to action. This book will, hopefully, spur the change needed to develop a culture of empathy among providers beginning in our training programs and carrying through to practices, hospitals and health systems." <i>&#x2015;</i>Wright Lassiter III, President &amp; CEO, Henry Ford Health System</p><p>"Dr. Rana Awdish suffered through catastrophic illness and loss as a young physician. Her perspective on her experiences as a patient transformed her understanding of how medicine is practiced today. <i>In Shock</i> reminds us of the essential aspect of the individual narrative and the vital importance of communication; not just between patients and their doctors but between doctors and themselves. Dr. Awdish's compassion for both her patients and those providing care for patients comes from profound insight into the vulnerability that illness imposes and the suffering that asks for acknowledgement and understanding." &#x2015;Susan Clark Ball, M.D., M.P.H, M.S., Associate Professor of Medicine at Weill Cornell Medical College and Assistant Director of the Bernbaum Unit, Center for Special Studies, New York Presbyterian Hospital</p><p>"<i>In Shock</i> is an ideal text for courses in narrative medicine, and similar classes that are now increasingly taught under a variety of names in medical schools nationwide. It is a welcome addition to a canon that includes such diverse works as Arthur Frank&#x2019;s <i>The Wounded Storyteller</i>, Danielle Ofri&#x2019;s <i>Singular Intimacies</i>, and <i>What Patients Say, What Doctors Feel</i>, Samuel Shem&#x2019;s <i>The House of God</i>. Together, these works lay bare the dilemma of the doctor in the age of the modern estrangement from care (as opposed to cure) and in bearing witness to this crisis, they urge us forward." &#x2015;Matthew von Unwerth, Program in Narrative Medicine, Columbia University</p><p>"Devastating and life-affirming all at the same time. As a fellow physician and mom, I founded myself immersed in <i>In Shock</i>, both by Rana Awdish&#x2019;s description of her heartbreaking losses as well as her triumphs of making it back to life repeatedly, to ultimately tell this story so beautifully. She reminds us all of the critical importance of maintaining our &#x201c;human-ness&#x201d; when we are taking care of the very ill." &#x2015;Lynn E. Fiellin, M.D., Associate Professor of Medicine and the Yale Child Study Center, Yale University School of Medicine</p><p>&#x201c;This book is remarkable&#x2015;should be required reading for every medical caregiver. <i>In Shock</i> is so beautifully written, so full of wisdom about illness, emotional connection and ripe with ideas for improving communication with my patients. I was so moved by Dr. Awdish&#x2019;s courage, resilience and passion to improve medical practice.&#x201d; &#x2015;Jeffrey Millstein, MD, Penn Medicine</p><p>"A very important book and the perfect antidote to the ever increasing canon of rather self-congratulatory medical literature hitting our shelves. Awdish looks at the way we practice medicine with a combination of love and outrage. She writes beautifully about the secret, shameful feelings many doctors feel they have to hide and she shows us how we might do better. After reading this book, I feel like a different doctor." &#x2015;Dr. Gabriel Weston, author of <i>Direct Red: A Surgeon's Story</i></p><p>&#x201c;Perhaps the bravest book that I have ever read in its gripping honesty and powerful lessons. An unrivaled view of healthcare as it really is&#x2015;its triumphs and missteps&#x2015;through the riveting, nakedly honest story of a physician who became seriously ill...reads like a page-turning novel.&#x201d; &#x2015;Leonard L. Berry, Ph.D., Regents Professor, Mays Business School, Texas A&amp;M University and Senior Fellow, Institute for Healthcare Improvement</p><p>"When Rana Awdish's brief description of her medical experiences was published in The New England Journal of Medicine, one leading health care expert (who did not know Rana) tweeted that everyone who takes care of patients should read it. The same is true for <i>In Shock</i>, her book that describes her medical ordeal and the insights that flowed from it. Her story of her clinical problems and what she experienced as she endured them reads like The Odyssey. The moment toward the end when she takes the stage to describe her experiences for her medical colleagues is nothing less than electrifying. And the insights about the nature of healing with which she concludes her book are an inspiration." &#x2015;Tom Lee, Chief Medical Officer for Press Ganey Associates, Inc.</p><p><i>"In Shock</i> is a brilliantly written account of Awdish's near death experience and what it is like to be on the "other side" of medicine. Through her sometimes shocking, often heartbreaking and always honest storytelling, Awdish poignantly brings to the forefront both our collective and individual shortcomings despite our best intentions. She clearly demonstrates the necessity and urgency for us to move away from "The House of God" culture, where we were trained to detach and depersonalize, to one that needs to be centered around empathy and caring, not just for the sake of our patients, but for our own humanity. The next generation will look back on<i> In Shock </i>as a transformational book and it will be mandatory reading for everyone in healthcare." &#x2015;Sara Hegab, MD, Senior Staff Physician, Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Henry Ford Hospital</p></p><h2>Eat Right 4 Your Type: Fully Revised with 10-day Jump-Start Plan</h2><p>Please Read Notes: Brand New, International Softcover Edition, Printed in black and white pages, minor self wear on the cover or pages, Sale restriction may be printed on the book, but Book name, contents, and author are exactly same as Hardcover Edition.

Read by audio pro Polly Adams, D'Adamo's bestseller details how different foods affect specific blood types both positively and negatively. We learn that "pastas made from buckwheat are better tolerated for Type Os," and that type As should eliminate all meat from their diet to reduce the risk of heart disease and cancer. Adams blends an efficient, no-nonsense delivery and warm tones that may remind some of a favorite talk-radio personality. And considering the important subject matter, listeners will appreciate all of these qualities. While some dieters may find the suggestions too progressive--it's recommended that women with a history of breast cancer in their family introduce snails into their diet--this is a beneficial three-hour investment for dieters seeking alternative nutritional plans. (Running time: three hours, two cassettes) <i>--Cate Bick</i>Dr. D&#39;Adamo has spent the past fifteen years researching the connections among blood type, food, and disease, and his research is built on thirty years of work done by his father.

In Eat Right 4 Your Type he shows which foods, spices, teas, and condiments help someone of your blood type maintain optimal health and ideal weight; which vitamins and supplements to emphasize or avoid; which medications function best in your system; whether your stress goes to your muscles or your nervous system; whether your stress is relieved better through aerobics or meditation; whether you should walk, swim or play tennis or golf as your mode of exercise; how knowing your blood type can help you avoid many common viruses and infections; how knowing your blood type can help you fight back against life-threatening diseases; and how to slow down the aging process by avoiding factors specific to your blood type that cause rapid cell deterioration.</p><h2>The Nerdy Nummies Cookbook: Sweet Treats for the Geek in All of Us</h2><p>The long-awaited first cookbook from the creator and host of the Internet&#x2019;s most popular baking show, <i>Nerdy Nummies</i>: a collection of Rosanna Pansino&#x2019;s all-time favorite geeky recipes as well as sensational new recipes exclusive to this book.<br><br><i>The Nerdy Nummies Cookbook</i> is quirky, charming, and fun, featuring the recipes behind Rosanna Pansino&#x2019;s celebrated, one-of-a-kind creations, as well as beautiful, mouthwatering photographs throughout.

Like the award-winning novel Freak the Mighty, this is Philbrick at his very best.</b><br><br>It's the story of an epileptic teenager nicknamed Spaz, who begins the heroic fight to bring human intelligence back to the planet. In a world where most people are plugged into brain-drain entertainment systems, Spaz is the rare human being who can see life as it really is. When he meets an old man called Ryter, he begins to learn about Earth and its past. With Ryter as his companion, Spaz sets off an unlikely quest to save his dying sister -- and in the process, perhaps the world.</p><p>Newbery Honor author Rodman Philbrick has written more than a dozen novels for young readers. In 1993, he published his first children&#x2019;s book, <i>Freak the Mighty</i>, which became an instant classic, and was made into a feature film. <i>The Mostly True Adventures of Homer P. Figg</i> was a 2010 Newbery Honor Book. Philbrick&#x2019;s other acclaimed novels include <i>Max the Mighty</i>, <i>The Young Man and the Sea</i>, <i>The Last Book in the Universe</i>, and <i>Zane and the Hurricane</i>. Philbrick divides his time between Maine and the Florida Keys. You can learn more about him on his website: rodmanphilbrick.com.Grade 5-8-Spaz, a boy who lives on the fringes of his surreal future world, partly because epilepsy prevents him from using the mind probes most people use to blot out reality, sets out on a classic quest to save his ill foster sister. To do so, he must cross forbidden territory and face frightening gangs and their leaders. He picks up companions as he travels: Ryter, a philosophic old man whose treasure is the book he is writing despite knowing that books and reading are of the past; Littleface, a young almost speechless child; and Linnea, a "prove" (genetically improved person). In saving his sister, Spaz learns about himself and his parentage. This action-packed story has some strong and provocative messages. It should prove popular among middle school listeners. Jeremy Davies' reading of Rodman Philbrick's text (Blue Sky Press, 2001) is very good. His soft, almost whispery voice usually suits the story well, but in the action scenes it is a little too subdued. This is a minor quibble. This is a good story to use with middle schoolers along with such titles as Lois Lowry's The Giver (HM, 1993) and Monica Hughes' Introduction to the Game (S&amp;S, 1990).

Bold graphics in vivid colors are interspersed with equally bold text in various font sizes. The front and back covers feature large mirrors to include youngsters in the story, making each reading unique to the two people sharing it. Most pages end with the refrain, "while we read this book together" to reinforce the idea of sharing stories and laptime together. Each page starts with a statement, such as, "THANK YOU FOR JOINING US/your arrival has been anxiously awaited." Upcoming highlights focus on music, cats, and stories. The graphic drawings are designed to look like universal signs, and while they will certainly engage young readers, they are also designed to make the presumably older book sharer chuckle.

The series was also nominated for an Eisner Award in the U.S. in 2008 and has been a regular <i>New York Times </i>bestseller.Starred Review. Yotsuba is the charming new girl in town in this all-ages shojo manga by the author of the popular Azumanga Daioh series. In seven stories, the green-haired four-year-old discovers air conditioners, doorbells, cicadas, swings and more, and does it all with the energy of a small hurricane. Her excitement is contagious and infects her handsome young adoptive father as well as the gaggle of pretty girls next door, all of whom get tangled up in her adventures as they try to keep up with her. But is there something strange about Yotsuba's lack of familiarity with the earthly world? The mystery of her origins is partially revealed in the final story: her father, Mr. Koiwai, found her and took her in, but Azuma seems to hint that there's more to be explained about Yotsuba. Koiwai sums up the reaction everyone seems to have to this little bundle of energy: "She can find happiness in anything," he says. "Nothing in this world can get her down." The plots here are little more than setups to explore everyday objects or concepts through the eyes of the irrepressible Yotsuba, but the genuinely sweet formula works, thanks to Azuma's solid storytelling and deft humor. <i>(June 6)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

This Hellenistic worldview challenged the adequacy of the religion passed down to the Palestinian Jews of the second century B.C.E. by their ancestors.

John Oetzel joined the team of Stephen Littlejohn and Karen Foss, adding his expertise in intercultural, health, and organizational communication.<p> The extensively updated edition is organized around two themes: elements of the basic communication model (communicator, message, medium, and "beyond" human communication) and communication contexts (relationship, group, organization, health, social media, culture, and society). A new chapter discusses frameworks by which theories can be organized, revealing how they contribute to and are impacted by larger issues about the nature of inquiry. Other outstanding features:</p><p> The text presents a full complement of foundational theories for the communication discipline, plus the contemporary evolutions of those theories.</p><p> Comprehensive, up-to-date coverage is based on a survey of the articles in communication journals over the last five years.</p><p> New areas covered include health, social media, and communication between humans and nature/objects/technology/the divine.</p><p> Each chapter covers an average of thirteen theories, half of which are new to this edition. "From the Source" boxes give students a look at the theorists behind the theories their inspirations, motivations, and goals. Chapters are organized around the concepts and themes inherent to how that area has been studied.</p><p> Students in upper-division undergraduate and in graduate-level courses will benefit from this well-organized, absorbing treatment of communication theory.</p><p> Not-for-sale instructor's resource materials available online to college and university faculty only; contact publisher directly.</p></p><p>"So far, this is my students' favorite textbook for communication theory.

He must have known that donning <i>the</i> rival jersey was bound to get a rise out of the other students. He arrogantly strutted around my class, taunting the other players that he was going to take their places on the field, then leisurely strolled to the back of the classroom and took a seat. <br><br>As I started to discuss the curriculum, my students rocked in their seats and played percussion with their pencils. Some checked their pagers, while others reapplied their eyeliner. Some slouched, some laid their heads on the desks, and some actually took a nap. This was not the reception I was hoping for on my first day as a student teacher. <br><br>I dodged a paper airplane&#x2014;made out of my syllabus, I quickly realized&#x2014;and tried to make myself heard over a string of &#x201c;yo mama&#x201d; jokes. <br><br>I fidgeted with my pearls. I glanced at the polka-dot dress I was wearing&#x2014;it was similar to the one that Julia Roberts wore in <i>Pretty Woman</i>&#x2014;and wondered if I had chosen the wrong profession.<br><br>Why hadn&#x2019;t I gone to law school like I&#x2019;d originally planned? In a courtroom, unlike this chaotic classroom, a judge would bang his gavel with gusto after the first projectile had flown across the room, and any innuendo about his mother&#x2019;s integrity would bring instant charges of contempt of court. I needed a daunting authority figure in a black robe to tell these kids that they were &#x201c;out of order.&#x201d; I looked around the room, but an authority figure was nowhere to be found. Then came a panicked realization&#x2014;I was the authority figure, armed only with a broken piece of chalk.<br><br>As a student teacher, I should have been able to rely on my supervising teacher, but he had stepped out of the classroom. When I met with him over the summer, he suggested that it would be a good idea for me to begin teaching on the first day of school, rather than easing my way into it. &#x201c;If you dive right in,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;you&#x2019;ll establish your authority from the get&#x2013;go.&#x201d; From the comfort of his living room, this suggestion sounded great. I had visions of passing out my syllabus and having students stick out their hands like Oliver Twist and ask for &#x201c;more.&#x201d; In reality, the only person requesting &#x201c;more&#x201d; was my supervising teacher, who conveniently snuck out to get &#x201c;more&#x201d; coffee and never returned.<br><br>After nearly forty years of teaching, my supervising teacher planned to retire at the end of the school year. He had emotionally checked out and was now simply coasting on autopilot. I&#x2019;d assumed student teachers were to be handled like timid student drivers, with someone ready to grab the wheel when changing lanes or parallel parking went awry. Since my so&#x2013;called mentor wasn&#x2019;t there to put on the brakes or take control, I didn&#x2019;t know which direction to go except forward.<br><br>To gain my composure, I tried to sound authoritative while reading my supervising teacher&#x2019;s &#x201c;Guidelines for Student Behavior.&#x201d; I heard some students snickering. I stopped reading to see what they were laughing about. <br><br>&#x201c;You got chalk on your ass,&#x201d; yelled a student from the back. <br><br>&#x201c;Daaamn, girl! Can I have some fries with that shake?&#x201d; said another. <br><br>Somehow the &#x201c;Guidelines&#x201d; weren&#x2019;t sticking, because the class was completely out of control. Even though I had studied classroom management, it was obvious that my students were the ones managing me. I just wanted to make it to the end of the hour.<br><br>Right before the bell rang, one of my students, Melvin, leaned back in his seat and announced, &#x201c;I give her five days!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re on,&#x201d; said Manny.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m gonna make this lady cry in front of the whole class,&#x201d; Sharaud bragged as he walked out the door.<br><br>At that moment, I could hear my father&#x2019;s smug &#x201c;I told you so&#x201d; echo in my mind. A little less foreboding than &#x201c;Beware the Ides of March,&#x201d; but accurate nevertheless.<br><br>I felt like a failure. It was obvious that I didn&#x2019;t know what I was doing. I had no idea how to engage these apathetic teenagers who hated reading, hated writing, and apparently hated me. And to make matters worse, student teachers did not receive salaries&#x2014;we actually paid for the privilege! I was holding down two part&#x2013;time jobs after school and on weekends to help pay for my semester&#x2019;s tuition at the university. I worked at Nordstrom department store as a salesclerk in the lingerie department and at a Marriott Hotel as a concierge. Paying to teach in the trenches was like putting my face through a cutout hole at a carnival while a quarterback threw pies at me. At least with a carnival, I&#x2019;d see it coming.<br><br>Once the students left, I picked up the paper airplane off the floor. I circled the room, collecting handouts that had been left behind, and saw ESL scribbled in black marker on several desks on the left side of the room. In educational jargon, ESL stands for English as a Second Language. Earlier, when I&#x2019;d seen <i>ESL</i> etched on my door, I&#x2019;d foolishly thought some Spanish-speaker was paying homage to my classroom. I soon realized this ESL had nothing to do with education&#x2014;it was the acronym for East Side Longos&#x2014;the largest Latino gang in Long Beach.<br><br>Similar gang insignias were on other desks. These defaced desks marked my students&#x2019; territory. The Asian students hit up the desks with the name of their respective gang affiliation, as did the African Americans. My multicultural classes in college had conveniently left out the chapter on gangs and turf warfare.<br><br>In lieu of a seating chart, I naively let the students pick their own seats. What struck me now was that they chose comfort zones determined by race. This realization gave me pause. I had imagined my students filing into my class and forming a melting pot of colors as they chose their seats, but the pot must have been pretty cold, because there was absolutely no melting. The Latinos had staked out the left side, while the Asian students occupied the right. The back row was occupied by all the African American students, and a couple of Caucasians sheepishly huddled together in the front.<br><br>My classroom wasn&#x2019;t the only place where the students segregated themselves. It was worse out on the school quad. During lunch, the students again separated themselves based on racial identity. The students even had nicknamed their distinct areas: &#x201c;Beverly Hills 90210,&#x201d; &#x201c;Chinatown&#x201d; (even though most of the students were immigrants from Cambodia), the &#x201c;Ghetto,&#x201d; and &#x201c;South of the Border.&#x201d;<br><br>The transparent segregation of the school shocked me, especially since I was expecting Wilson to be a model of integration. On paper, it was one of the most culturally diverse schools in the country, and I&#x2019;d chosen to studentteach at Wilson for exactly that reason. Clearly, there was a disparity between what I&#x2019;d read about Wilson High and its reality. <br><br>My dad used to share stories about seeing segregation firsthand. In the early sixties, when he was drafted to play minor league baseball for the Washington Senators, some of his teammates were forced to drink out of separate fountains, eat at different sections in restaurants, and stay at separate motels whenever his team traveled through the South. As a catcher, my dad said &#x201c;he judged a batter by his swing, not the color of his skin.&#x201d; So when Hank Aaron started hitting balls out of the park, my father hailed him as his new hero and named his daughter Erin in honor of the legendary batter.<br><br>I was fascinated by my namesake for challenging the status quo and thus helping to change the face of America&#x2019;s favorite pastime. I hoped Hammerin&#x2019; Hank&#x2019;s influence would make its way out of the stadiums and into the classrooms. Disappointingly, it didn&#x2019;t.<br><br>After lunch, all the kids from the &#x201c;Beverly Hills 90210&#x201d; section trotted to class together. Among them were students whose apparel and matching school sweatshirts identified them as water polo players, cheerleaders, and student council members. Their classrooms had banners that read &#x201c;Home of the Distinguished Scholars,&#x201d; along with freshly published textbooks and new computers. In contrast, my room was pretty barren. It didn&#x2019;t have any banners, much less a computer. All I had to work with were hand&#x2013;me&#x2013;down textbooks riddled with graffiti. <br><br>In the Distinguished Scholars classrooms, the desks were neatly lined up and filled primarily with Caucasians. Nestled between the rows may have been an occasional African American or Asian student, but it was clear that a tracking system was in place.<br><br>The few Caucasians in my class were stigmatized as outcasts by their friends in the Distinguished Scholars program. The general assumption was that they had failed out of the Distinguished Scholars program, had a learning disability, or had just returned from rehab. By the look of things, some were probably on their way back in.<br><br>There was a perception in the affluent neighborhood south of the school that the caliber of students attending Wilson had plummeted in recent years. At one point, Wilson High was considered a highly desirable public high school, but there had been noticeable &#x201c;white flight&#x201d; after the school district implemented an intradistrict busing program. By the early nineties, the Caucasian population had decreased to less than twenty-five percent. Some speculated that the Distinguished Scholars program was an attempt to rescue the school&#x2019;s declining reputation and keep neighborhood kids from transferring out. My hope was that I could find something &#x201c;distinguished&#x201d; in all of my students.<br><br>At the end of my first day, the security guard popped his head into my class. Earlier that morning, he had stopped me in the hallway. He had a walkie-talkie in one hand and a metal-detector wand in the other. &#x201c;We have zero tolerance for weapons on campus,&#x201d; he&#x2019;d warned me. Then he asked to see my ID. I handed him my student ID card from the university. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m a student teacher,&#x201d; I stammered. &#x201c;I will be teaching junior English.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Sorry,&#x201d; he said with a shrug, &#x201c;you look like one of the students.&#x201d; <br><br>Now the security guard was here to tell me, &#x201c;There&#x2019;s a police officer looking for you.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Why?&#x201d; I asked. &#x201c;Did somebody steal my car?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; he laughed, &#x201c;he said he knows you.&#x201d;<br><br>I went to the office and was surprised to see my old neighbor, Mark, in full police uniform. <br><br>&#x201c;Mark, what are you doing here?&#x201d; I asked.<br><br>&#x201c;Your brother asked me to check up on you,&#x201d; he said. Mark had been checking up on me since I was seven. He even threatened to beat up neighborhood boys with his nunchucks simply for flirting with me when we were in the sixth grade.<br><br>Mark and I had grown up in the same gated community, but I always suspected that he wanted to keep people out of those gates, whereas I wanted to bring them in. Our paths diverged after high school. I went on to college, and Mark entered the police academy. Coincidentally, we both ended up in Long Beach. It was obvious that Mark had not come to Long Beach out of moral obligation. He came to Long Beach because that&#x2019;s where the action was.<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t see any bullet holes, so I assume you survived your first day,&#x201d; he said.<br><br>&#x201c;Barely!&#x201d; I laughed. &#x201c;My family&#x2019;s a little paranoid,&#x201d; I offered. &#x201c;My father called me this morning and said, &#x2018;Erin, no matter what you do, please don&#x2019;t eat the apples!&#x2019; He&#x2019;s convinced they&#x2019;re laced with strychnine or razor blades.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s probably right!&#x201d; he said, and chuckled.<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, come on. It&#x2019;s not that bad!&#x201d; I said.<br><br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t tell me it&#x2019;s not that bad. I&#x2019;m a cop, remember? I&#x2019;m the one arresting these kids. There are parts of Long Beach that are like a war zone. Especially after the Rodney King riots. There have been about a hundred gang&#x2013;related murders in Long Beach already this year.&#x201d;<br><br>Growing up, my only exposure to &#x201c;gangs&#x201d; had been through the media or movies. My &#x201c;hip&#x201d; high school English teacher made us watch West Side Story to understand how the Montagues and the Capulets in Romeo and Juliet were like modern gangs. &#x201c;Gangs&#x201d; like the Jets and Sharks had staged rumbles. In real life, Jerome Robbins wasn&#x2019;t choreographing Friday&#x2013;night fights in Long Beach.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;d hate to see you get caught in the cross fire,&#x201d; Mark said. &#x201c;Just be careful.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I will,&#x201d; I said, hugging him good-bye. <br><br>The security guard, who had been eavesdropping on my entire conversation, said, &#x201c;He&#x2019;s right, you know. Long Beach has changed a lot.&#x201d;<br><br>At that moment, I just wanted to escape. I&#x2019;d had enough negativity for one day, so I ducked into the teachers&#x2019; lounge to seek solace. The moment I walked in, conversation stopped. They looked me up and down and said nothing. They didn&#x2019;t offer me a chair, a cup of coffee, or a word of encouragement. I looked down and noticed their open&#x2013;toed Birkenstocks, in earthy contrast to my pumps. I must have looked like I had just stepped out of a Talbot&#x2019;s catalog. I was definitely overdressed.<br><br>Their disapproving glances brought out insecurities that had never surfaced before. Obviously, I hadn&#x2019;t made a good first impression. Maybe it was the polka dots. Or maybe it was my Tiffany pearls that pushed it over the top. Even though I craved their acceptance, it was pretty obvious that these particular teachers didn&#x2019;t want me in their clique&#x2014;or their lounge, for that matter. Maybe I was too young, too preppy, or maybe they assumed I&#x2019;d been born with a silver spoon in my mouth. Their uncomfortable silence made it pretty obvious that they felt I didn&#x2019;t belong.<br><br>I stood against the wall and listened to disgruntled banter about the new crop of students dubbed as &#x201c;rejects.&#x201d; Apparently, my class was not the only place where things had gone awry. The teachers, many of whom had taught at Wilson since the &#x201c;good old days,&#x201d; were discussing how the school was &#x201c;going to hell in a handbasket.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;This place has gone downhill ever since those kids started getting bussed in from the projects,&#x201d; one teacher said.<br><br>&#x201c;<i>They</i> don&#x2019;t even care about school,&#x201d; said another.<br><br>&#x201c;<i>They</i> don&#x2019;t care about anything!&#x201d; said another.<br><br>Their casual banter about those kids was startling. I was troubled by how nonchalant they were with their pejorative comments. After a string of generalizations about those kids, the teachers moved on to something more specific.<br><br>&#x201c;Did you hear about the latest disciplinary transfer from Poly?&#x201d; one of the teachers asked.<br><br>I instantly suspected that they were talking about Sharaud, because he had sauntered into my class wearing his Poly jersey. &#x201c;I heard he brought a gun to Poly last year and was planning to shoot everyone in the teachers&#x2019; lounge.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No, I heard he was planning to shoot his English teacher,&#x201d; said another teacher.<br><br>&#x201c;They only let him in here because they couldn&#x2019;t find the gun. It&#x2019;s just a matter of time before that boy blows someone away,&#x201d; said another. <br><br>After being sufficiently ignored and hearing tales of how Sharaud would single-handedly destroy the institution. I decided I couldn't handle it anymore. I grabbed my bag and headed for the door. No one said good&#x2013;bye. Why would they? They hadn&#x2019;t even bothered to say hello.<br><br>I fumbled for my keys as I dashed to my car. The lingering conversation about Sharaud had struck fear into me. What if I was the next teacher who triggered him?</p><h2>Idols of Perversity: Fantasies of Feminine Evil in Fin-de-Si�cle Culture (Oxford Paperbacks)</h2><p>At the turn of the century, an unprecedented attack on women erupted in virtually every aspect of culture: literary, artistic, scientific, and philosophic. Throughout Europe and America, artists and intellectuals banded together to portray women as static and unindividuated beings who functioned solely in a sexual and reproductive capacity, thus formulating many of the anti-feminine platitudes that today still constrain women's potential.<br> Bram Dijkstra's <em>Idols of Perversity</em> explores the nature and development of turn-of-the-century misogyny in the works of hundreds of writers, artists, and scientists, including Zola, Strindberg, Wedekind, Henry James, Rossetti, Renoir, Moreau, Klimt, Darwin, and Spencer. Dijkstra demonstrates that the most prejudicial aspects of Evolutionary Theory helped to justify this wave of anti-feminine sentiment. The theory claimed that the female of the species could not participate in the great evolutionary process that would guide the intellectual male to his ultimate, predestined role as a disembodied spiritual essence. Darwinists argued that women hindered this process by their willingness to lure men back to a sham paradise of erotic materialism. To protect the male's continued evolution, artists and intellectuals produced a flood of pseudo-scientific tracts, novels, and paintings which warned the world's males of the evils lying beneath the surface elegance of woman's tempting skin.<br> Reproducing hundreds of pictures from the period and including in-depth discussions of such key works as <em>Dracula</em> and <em>Venus in Furs</em>, this fascinating book not only exposes the crucial links between misogyny then and now, but also connects it to the racism and anti-semitism that led to catastrophic genocidal delusions in the first half of the twentieth century. Crossing the conventional boundaries of art history, sociology, the history of scientific theory, and literary analysis, Dijkstra unveils a startling view of a grim and largely one-sided war on women still being fought today.<br></p><p>This is a book filled with the dangerous fantasies of the Beautiful People of a century ago. It contains a few scenes of exemplary virtue and many more of lurid sin.<br><em>About the Author</em>:<br> <strong>Bram Dijkstra</strong> is Professor of Comparative Literature at the University of California, San Diego, and author of several books, including <em>Cubism, Stieglitz and the Early Poetry of William Carlos Williams</em>, <em>A Recognizable Image</em>, and <em>Defoe and Economics</em>.<br></p><h2>Russian for Beginners</h2><p>A full, simplified approach to grammar, a 4,000-word vocabulary, and 42 lessons in the basic principles of the language. A useful guidebook for anyone who wants to learn Russian--especially the serious student.</p><p>This provides a full, simplified introduction to grammar, a 4,000-word vocabulary, and 42 lessons in the basic principles of the language.</p><h2>A Marginal Jew, Volume Three: Rethinking the Historical Jesus (Marginal Jew Rethinking the Historical Jesus)</h2><p>The third volume of the author&#39;s monumental study of the historical Jesus goes beyond the person of Jesus himself to offer incisive portraits of hisboth his followers and such rival groups as the Pharisees and Zealots and examines his ministry in terms of its role and influence amid the political, social, and religious movements of his era.</p><p>No man is an island, not even Jesus, as John Meier writes in <i>Companions and Competitors</i>, the third installment of his four-part series, <i>A Marginal Jew: Rethinking the Historical Jesus</i>. The first volume, an overview of Jesus' background, chronology, and early years, was followed by a second that analyzed Jesus' most important messages and deeds. Here, Meier explains his conviction that "No human being is adequately understood if he or she is considered in isolation from other human beings." He leads readers through the concentric circles of companions (including the followers who became his disciples and apostles) and competitors (such as Pharisees, Sadducees, Essenes, Samaritans) that shaped Jesus' life in first-century Palestine. Meier, a priest and New Testament scholar at Notre Dame, writes in the engaging, methodical style of an astringently avuncular professor: chapters are carefully outlined, with straightforward headings such as "Points of Comparison and Contrast," "Caveats on Comparisons," and "The Sheer Oddness of Jesus"). His findings, particularly his explanation of "the essentially Jewish nature" of Jesus' relationships, are a valuable addition to the field of Historical Jesus scholarship. <i>--Michael Joseph Gross</i>*Starred Review* Meier is a persistent critic of John Dominic Crossan, Burton Mack, Robert Funk, and others associated with the Jesus Seminar--scholars he criticizes for not taking the Jewishness of Jesus seriously; for example, he scores Crossan's attention to the issue as "political correctness." Despite the dismissive tone, his argument is important; and he puts forth substantial material here to enable readers to make their own judgments about the relative importance of Hebrew and Hellenistic influences on Jesus. Meier summarizes the first two volumes of <i>A Marginal Jew</i> and forecasts the next while meticulously documenting his understanding of the relations between the historical Jesus, his historical companions, and his historical competitors--Pharisees, Sadduccees, Essenes, and others. He reads the companions in concentric circles, moving from the crowds that followed Jesus to the inner circle of disciples. It is possible to be skeptical of Meier's multiple attestations, for there is virtually no material outside the Christian community from which to draw information about Jesus, and still benefit from his close readings of available texts. If it seems puzzling that Meier should take four volumes and more than 2,000 pages to make a case he says is obvious to anyone who approaches the issues and materials with common sense, be assured that the only thing common about Meier's project is fascination with the character of Jesus. Those who share that will find this dense, academic work worth their effort. <i>Steven Schroeder</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

According to U.S. Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, a judge like this can maneuver through earlier cases to achieve the desired aim&#x2015;"distinguishing one prior case on his left, straight-arming another one on his right, high-stepping away from another precedent about to tackle him from the rear, until (bravo!) he reaches the goal&#x2015;good law." But is this common-law mindset, which is appropriate in its place, suitable also in statutory and constitutional interpretation? In a witty and trenchant essay, Justice Scalia answers this question with a resounding negative.</p><p>In exploring the neglected art of statutory interpretation, Scalia urges that judges resist the temptation to use legislative intention and legislative history. In his view, it is incompatible with democratic government to allow the meaning of a statute to be determined by what the judges think the lawgivers meant rather than by what the legislature actually promulgated. Eschewing the judicial lawmaking that is the essence of common law, judges should interpret statutes and regulations by focusing on the text itself. Scalia then extends this principle to constitutional law. He proposes that we abandon the notion of an everchanging Constitution and pay attention to the Constitution's original meaning. Although not subscribing to the &#x201c;strict constructionism&#x201d; that would prevent applying the Constitution to modern circumstances, Scalia emphatically rejects the idea that judges can properly &#x201c;smuggle&#x201d; in new rights or deny old rights by using the Due Process Clause, for instance. In fact, such judicial discretion might lead to the destruction of the Bill of Rights if a majority of the judges ever wished to reach that most undesirable of goals.</p><p>This essay is followed by four commentaries by Professors Gordon Wood, Laurence Tribe, Mary Ann Glendon, and Ronald Dworkin, who engage Justice Scalia&#x2019;s ideas about judicial interpretation from varying standpoints. In the spirit of debate, Justice Scalia responds to these critics.</p><p>Featuring a new foreword that discusses Scalia&#x2019;s impact, jurisprudence, and legacy, this witty and trenchant exchange illuminates the brilliance of one of the most influential legal minds of our time.</p></p><p><b>Antonin Scalia (1936&#x2013;2016)</b> was an associate justice of the U.S. Supreme Court."<i>A Matter of Interpretation</i> demonstrates both the attraction of Scalia's 'textualist' theory and his qualities as a judicial statesman. . . [His] elegant essay, the most concise and accessible presentation of his views, argues eloquently that judicial authority can only be based on the statutory or constitutional text."<b>---Michael Greve, <i>Reason</i></b><br><br>"As the most intellectually consistent and stylistically gifted member of the Supreme Court, Scalia has never hidden his enthusiasm for the American tradition of mistrusting courts and lawyers. The basics of his judicial philosophy are now usefully collated into this volume. . . . Scalia's arguments have shaped the debate in our time; he has gone a long way toward changing how judges interpret the letter of the law."<b>---David Franklin, <i>Slate</i></b><br><br>"Whether you agree with [Scalia's] views or not, it is hard to think of any other recent Supreme Court justice who has made a comparably great contribution to debates over both statutory interpretation and constitutional theory."<b>---Ilya Somin, <i>Washington Post</i></b><br><br>"[T]he Supreme Court's highest-profile conservative . . . Suggest[s] we ought to junk judicial review as we have known it. . . . The reason, I think, is that Scalia objects not merely to certain decisions of this or prior Courts but to judicial review, American-style, in its entirety. His central aim as a jurist has been to get the federal courts out of the business of adjudicating individual rights."<b>---Garrett Epps, <i>The Nation</i></b><br><br>"[Scalia] is formidably persuasive, by turns seductive, fierce, funny, charming--and always brilliant."<b>---Paul Reidinger, <i>American Bar Association Journal</i></b><br><br>"[We] are lucky to have, in book form, an essay on legal interpretation by Justice Scalia. . . . [He] projects a sanguine humor through a robust prose enlivened by sly sallies against what he sees as the gaps in logic of the opposing camp. He is anything but the angry justice of popular myth."<b>---John O. McGinnis, <i>Wall Street Journal</i></b><br><br>"Love him or hate him (it's hard to imagine a neutral opinion), Scalia is a brilliant and engaging writer. This tantalizing short debate with his equally brilliant critics shows just how radical our most conservative justice is."<b>---Kathleen Kahn, <i>San Francisco Chronicle</i></b><br><br>"An essential volume."<b>---Noah Feldman, <i>Bloomberg View</i></b><br><br>"As this . . . book makes clear, Scalia deserves respect for having redefined the mainstream of constitutional discourse, and in a substantially useful way."<b>---Jeffrey Rosen, <i>New Republic</i></b><br><br>"Antonin Scalia. . . confronts four high-powered critics in a short book for the general public--perhaps the first time a sitting justice of the Supreme Court has done so. This is a book for anyone with a serious interest in law and the Constitution."<b>---Carl M.

Prospero is exiled on an island, where his only companions are his daughter, Miranda, the spirit Ariel, and the monster Caliban. When his enemies are among those caught in a storm near the island, Prospero turns his power upon them through Ariel and other spirits.<br> <br>The characters exceed the roles of villains and heroes. Prospero seems heroic, yet he enslaves Caliban and has an appetite for revenge. Caliban seems to be a monster for attacking Miranda, but appears heroic in resisting Prospero, evoking the period of colonialism during which the play was written. Miranda&#x2019;s engagement to Ferdinand, the Prince of Naples and a member of the shipwrecked party, helps resolve the drama.<br> <br>The authoritative edition of <i>The Tempest</i> from The Folger Shakespeare Library, the trusted and widely used Shakespeare series for students and general readers, includes:<br> <br>-Freshly edited text based on the best early printed version of the play<br> -Full explanatory notes conveniently placed on pages facing the text of the play<br> -Scene-by-scene plot summaries<br> -A key to the play&#x2019;s famous lines and phrases<br> -An introduction to reading Shakespeare&#x2019;s language<br> -An essay by a leading Shakespeare scholar providing a modern perspective on the play<br> -Fresh images from the Folger Shakespeare Library&#x2019;s vast holdings of rare books<br> -An annotated guide to further reading<br> <br>Essay by Barbara A.

When he was eighteen, he married Anne Hathaway. The couple had three children&#x2014;an older daughter Susanna and twins, Judith and Hamnet. Hamnet, Shakespeare&#x2019;s only son, died in childhood. The bulk of Shakespeare&#x2019;s working life was spent in the theater world of London, where he established himself professionally by the early 1590s. He enjoyed success not only as a playwright and poet, but also as an actor and shareholder in an acting company. Although some think that sometime between 1610 and 1613 Shakespeare retired from the theater and returned home to Stratford, where he died in 1616, others believe that he may have continued to work in London until close to his death.<br><br>Barbara A. Mowat is Director of Research&nbsp;<i>emerita</i>&nbsp;at the Folger Shakespeare Library, Consulting Editor of&nbsp;<i>Shakespeare Quarterly</i>, and author of&nbsp;<i>The Dramaturgy of Shakespeare&#x2019;s Romances</i>&nbsp;and of essays on Shakespeare&#x2019;s plays and their editing.<br><br>Paul Werstine is Professor of English at the Graduate School and at King&#x2019;s University College at Western University. He is a general editor of the New Variorum Shakespeare and author of&nbsp;<i>Early Modern Playhouse Manuscripts and the Editing of Shakespeare</i>&nbsp;and of many papers and articles on the printing and editing of Shakespeare&#x2019;s plays.The Tempest An Introduction to This Text<p></p> <br>The Tempest was first printed in the 1623 collection of Shakespeare&#x2019;s plays now known as the First Folio. The present edition is based directly upon that printing.I For the convenience of the reader, we have modernized the punctuation and the spelling of the Folio. Sometimes we go so far as to modernize certain old forms of words; for example, when a means &#x201c;he,&#x201d; we change it to he; we change mo to more, and ye to you. But it is not our practice in editing any of the plays to modernize words that sound distinctly different from modern forms. For example, when the early printed texts read sith or apricocks or porpentine, we have not modernized to since, apricots, porcupine. When the forms an, and, or and if appear instead of the modern form if, we have reduced and to an but have not changed any of these forms to their modern equivalent, if. We also modernize and, where necessary, correct passages in foreign languages, unless an error in the early printed text can be reasonably explained as a joke.<br> <br>Whenever we change the wording of the First Folio or add anything to its stage directions, we mark the change by enclosing it in superior half-brackets (&lt; &gt;). We want our readers to be immediately aware when we have intervened. (Only when we correct an obvious typographical error in the First Folio does the change not get marked.) Whenever we change either the First Folio&#x2019;s wording or its punctuation so that meaning changes, we list the change in the textual notes at the back of the book, even if all we have done is fix an obvious error.<br> <br>We regularize a number of the proper names, as is the usual practice in editions of the play. For example, the Folio once names the Boatswain the &#x201c;Boson,&#x201d; a form that is interesting for its reproduction of the word&#x2019;s pronunciation; nevertheless, we regularize this spelling to boatswain. The Folio often employs the spelling Anthonio for Antonio in stage directions and speech headings, but this edition is consistent in using only Antonio.<br> <br>This edition differs from many earlier ones in its efforts to aid the reader in imagining the play as a performance rather than as a series of actual events. Thus stage directions are written with reference to the stage. For example, many earlier editions add the following stage direction to the play&#x2019;s last scene to describe an important piece of stage business: &#x201c;Prospero draws a magic circle with his staff.&#x201d; Because, in a stage production, the circle drawn by the actor is, of course, not &#x201c;magic&#x201d; at all, we instead print the following stage direction: &#x201c;Prospero draws a large circle on the stage with his staff.&#x201d; Whenever it is reasonably certain, in our view, that a speech is accompanied by a particular action, we provide a stage direction describing the action. (Occasional exceptions to this rule occur when the action is so obvious that to add a stage direction would insult the reader.) Stage directions for the entrance of characters in mid-scene are, with rare exceptions, placed so that they immediately precede the characters&#x2019; participation in the scene, even though these entrances may appear somewhat earlier in the early printed texts. Whenever we move a stage direction, we record this change in the textual notes. Latin stage directions (e.g., Exeunt) are translated into English (e.g., They exit).<br> <br>We expand the often severely abbreviated forms of names used as speech headings in early printed texts into the full names of the characters. We also regularize the speakers&#x2019; names in speech headings, using only a single designation for each character, even though the early printed texts sometimes use a variety of designations. Variations in the speech headings of the early printed texts are recorded in the textual notes.<br> <br>In the present edition, as well, we mark with a dash any change of address within a speech, unless a stage direction intervenes. When the -ed ending of a word is to be pronounced, we mark it with an accent. Like editors for the past two centuries we print metrically linked lines in the following way:<br> <br>PROSPERO<br> <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But are they, Ariel, safe?<br> <br>ARIEL&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not a hair perished.<br> <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1.2.257&#x2013;58)<br> <br>However, when there are a number of short verse lines that can be linked in more than one way, we do not, with rare exceptions, indent any of them.<br> The Explanatory Notes<p></p> <br>The notes that appear in the commentary linked to the text are designed to provide readers with the help they may need to enjoy the play. Whenever the meaning of a word in the text is not readily accessible in a good contemporary dictionary, we offer the meaning in a note. Sometimes we provide a note even when the relevant meaning is to be found in the dictionary but when the word has acquired since Shakespeare&#x2019;s time other potentially confusing meanings. In our notes, we try to offer modern synonyms for Shakespeare&#x2019;s words. We also try to indicate to the reader the connection between the word in the play and the modern synonym. For example, Shakespeare sometimes uses the word head to mean &#x201c;source,&#x201d; but, for modern readers, there may be no connection evident between these two words. We provide the connection by explaining Shakespeare&#x2019;s usage as follows: &#x201c;head: fountainhead, source.&#x201d; On some occasions, a whole phrase or clause needs explanation. Then we rephrase in our own words the difficult passage, and add at the end synonyms for individual words in the passage. When scholars have been unable to determine the meaning of a word or a phrase, we acknowledge the uncertainty.<br> <br>I. We have also consulted the computerized text of the First Folio provided by the Text Archive of the Oxford University Computing Centre, to which we are grateful.</p><h2>Don Quixote: The Ormsby Translation, Revised Backgrounds and Sources Criticism (Norton Critical Editions) (English and Spanish Edition)</h2><p>A middle-aged Spaniard, impressed by the fantasy he finds in books, sets off with his servant to revive the age of chivalry</p><p>Publikum Art produces beautifully designed and wonderfully illustrated gift merchandise and blank journals that celebrate great works of literature.Text: English, Spanish (translation)</p><h2>No Risk Ranching: Custom Grazing on Leased Land</h2><p><p>Greg Judy was forced to liquidate his cow herd to pay debt in 1996. By the end of the following year he was dead broke and figured the family farm was history. A quote from Allan Nation, editor of <em>The Stockman Grass Farmer</em> magazine changed his whole view of ranching. Nation said, &#x201c;Your sole purpose should be not to own the land, but to make a living from the land.&#x201d;</p> <p>Inspired by that approach, Judy started looking for idle, non-developed pastureland. By focusing on leasing rather than owning land, his grazing operation grew from 40 stockers to 1100 head. By custom grazing on leased land he was able to pay his entire farm and home loan within three years. Today he has four farms and leases 12.</p> <p><em>No Risk Ranching, Custom Grazing on Leased Land</em> describes how he found and managed his first and subsequent leases. He offers a detailed guide for other graziers to follow on how to find idle land to lease; calculate the cost of a lease; draft and write a land lease contract (with examples included); develop good water and portable fencing on leased land; promote wildlife and improve timber stands; keep accurate records and more.</p> <p><em>No Risk Ranching</em> was written to help other graziers from making the same mistakes Judy made. He writes, &#x201c;I am convinced that in the USA our pastures are one of our most underutilized natural resources. I am not against land ownership. I just feel like it is an awful hardship on a new blooming grazing business.&#x201d;</p></p><p><p>Along with his wife Jan, Greg Judy of Clark, Missouri, runs a grazing operation on 1620 acres of leased and owned land. Greg and Jan went from near bankruptcy in 1999 to paying off a 200-acre farm and house in 3 years with custom grazing on leased land and are completely debt free today.</p> <p>Today they own 4 farms and lease 12 farms. Holistic High Density Planned Grazing is used to graze cow/calf pairs, bred heifers, bulls, and stockers. They own a 350 head grass genetic cow herd, 200 hair sheep flock, graze heritage breed pigs, train guardian dogs, and raise shitake mushrooms. They have also begun an on-farm sawmill operation to direct market lumber from the timbered areas on their farms. They direct market grass-fed beef, lamb, pork, mushrooms and lumber. They also market grass genetic bulls and heifers along with parasite resistant rams and ewe lambs.</p> <p>Greg &amp; Jan also have a ranch internship program that brings young folks onto their ranch to teach them how to manage their own successful grazing operations.</p><p>"Missouri grazier Greg Judy has written a textbook of how to build a sizeable ranch starting with absolutely no capital. <em>No Risk Ranching</em> should be ready by every young grazier dreaming of having a big place someday. Judy will show you that you can have it very fast if you will just ask for it."<strong>&#x2013;Allan Nation <em>The Stockman Grass Farmer</em></strong></p></p><h2>Portrait of a Novel: Henry James and the Making of an American Masterpiece</h2><p><p><strong>Finalist for the Pulitzer Prize<br> Finalist for National Book Critics Circle Award: Biography<br> One of the Best Books of 2012: <em>The New Yorker, Wall Street Journal, Guardian, The Millions, Kirkus Reviews, Boston Phoenix</em><br> A revelatory biography of the American master as told through the lens of his greatest novel.</strong></p> Henry James (1843&#x2013;1916) has had many biographers, but Michael Gorra has taken an original approach to this great American progenitor of the modern novel, combining elements of biography, criticism, and travelogue in re-creating the dramatic backstory of James&#x2019;s masterpiece, <em>Portrait of a Lady</em> (1881). Gorra, an eminent literary critic, shows how this novel&#x2015;the scandalous story of the expatriate American heiress Isabel Archer&#x2015;came to be written in the first place. Traveling to Florence, Rome, Paris, and England, Gorra sheds new light on James&#x2019;s family, the European literary circles&#x2015;George Eliot, Flaubert, Turgenev&#x2015;in which James made his name, and the psychological forces that enabled him to create this most memorable of female protagonists. Appealing to readers of Menand&#x2019;s <em>The Metaphysical Club</em> and McCullough&#x2019;s <em>The Greater Journey</em>, <em>Portrait of a Novel</em> provides a brilliant account of the greatest American novel of expatriate life ever written. It becomes a piercing detective story on its own. 10 illustrations</p><p>Michael Gorra teaches English at Smith College. His books include After Empire, The Bells in Their Silence, and, as editor, the Norton Critical Edition of Faulkner&#x2019;s As I Lay Dying. He lives in Northampton, Massachusetts.&#x201c;In this innovative biography, written with flair and unostentatious erudition, Gorra tells the life of Henry James through the story of the composition of his novel, <em>The Portrait of a Lady</em>. ...Analyzing James&#x2019;s letters, journals, stories, and travelogues, Gorra traces the author&#x2019;s life and literary milieu, alternating a reconstruction of his travels with extensive attention to the novel&#x2019;s composition and reception. The book reads like an exciting voyage of discovery, beginning with James revising his novel 20 years after it was written, and later depicting his blooming consciousness as an author torn between an American and a European identity. Gorra&#x2019;s highly engaging introduction to James will be most attractive to lovers of literature who want to learn more about the craft of novel writing and will likely send readers back to the shelves to discover James all over again.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Publishers Weekly</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Starred review. Throughout this work of astonishing scholarship, Gorra directs our attention to the quotidian life of James (and his remarkable family), his composition of the novel (which first appeared in serial installments in the <em>Atlantic</em> here and <em>Macmillan&#x2019;s Magazine</em> in England), the significance of the events and characters in the story, and the influence of the novel on the subsequent fiction of James and others....

The reader does not have to love or even be particularly familiar with James&#x2019;s work to enjoy this book; this is as much a story about the creative process itself, or the function of genius, as it is about any particular product.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Nicholas Mancusi, Daily Beast, <em>Daily Beast</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Both personal and profound. Michael Gorra&#x2019;s intense focus on a single work reflects his deep curiosity about this novel and displays his loving scrutiny of it. Gorra&#x2019;s study, while keeping <em>The Portrait of a Lady</em>, its heroine Isabel Archer, and the years of its creation (1880-81) at its center, roams gracefully through James&#x2019;s life and art.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Barbara Fisher, <em>Boston Globe</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;<em>Portrait of a Novel</em> does a great deal to explain why James&#x2019;s book should have proved so timeless, so timely, and so enduring. Incisive, informative and hugely entertaining, Michael Gorra&#x2019;s &#x2018;tale not of a life but of a work&#x2019; is at once a brisk, compressed biography of James... [N]ot only instructive and a pleasure to read, but (as Gorra doubtless intended) it also sends us back to James with a deeper appreciation for his literary technique, his painstaking approach to language and style, and above all, the genius and profundity with which he portrayed the characters who continue to populate our imaginative world and accompany us, at home and abroad.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Francine Prose, <em>The Sunday Times (UK)</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;One of the many pleasures of Michael Gorra&#x2019;s book is that he too has loved this novel since he studied it in college, and wants to share his passion for it.

This is simply one of the greatest biographical achievements of recent years. Shelley, the most neglected of all the great Romantic poets, was born in Sussex in 1792 and died in Tuscany in 1822, a brief life packed with love affairs, alarums and excursions. Holmes&#39;s book offers a serious and critical reappraisal of Shelley as a man and a writer; all his prose and poetry is carefully re-examined, his sense of spiritual and geographical isolation brilliantly described and a detailed portrait of his macabre imaginative life slowly assembled. Shelley&#39;s intense friendships with some of the most remarkable figures of his age fill Holmes&#39;s pages with a vivid parorama of revolutionary idealism and recklessness. To this is added the private story of Shelley&#39;s tortuous romantic liaisons, complications which affected both the peculiar tenor of his daily life and the remotest conceptions of his poetry. This is a stunning, entrancing biography of a fascinating subject, and a timely reissue of an absolutely seminal work.</p><p>Richard Holmes is the author of The Age of Wonder, which won the Royal Society Prize for Science Books and the National Book Critics Circle Award and was one of the ten New York Times' Best Books of the Year in 2009.

Kristin L. Hoganson shows how gendered ideas about citizenship and political leadership influenced jingoist political leaders` desire to wage these conflicts, and she traces how they manipulated ideas about gender to embroil the nation in war.<br><br> She argues that racial beliefs were only part of the cultural framework that undergirded U.S. martial policies at the turn of the century. Gender beliefs, also affected the rise and fall of the nation`s imperialist impulse.<br> &nbsp;Drawing on an extensive range of sources, including congressional debates, campaign speeches, political tracts, newspapers, magazines, political cartoons, and the papers of politicians, soldiers, suffragists, and other political activists, Hoganson discusses how concerns about manhood affected debates over war and empire. She demonstrates that jingoist political leaders, distressed by the passing of the Civil War generation and by women`s incursions into electoral politics, embraced war as an opportunity to promote a political vision in which soldiers were venerated as model citizens and women remained on the fringes of political life. These gender concerns not only played an important role in the Spanish-American and Philippine-American wars, they have echoes in later time periods, says the author, and recognizing their significance has powerful ramifications for the way we view international relations.Yale Historical Publications</p><p>Blending gender, political, and foreign policy history, this groundbreaking book offers a new understanding of the Spanish-American and Philippine-American wars.

Already winning fans around the world, Owly is not to be missed.</p><p>Gr. 3-5. In this third book in the Owly series, Owly and Wormy are eager to make friends with their new neighbor, a flying squirrel. Unfortunately, flying squirrels are afraid of owls. Wormy tries to convince the squirrel that Owly is kind and gentle, but the squirrel is doubtful; it likes Wormy immensely, however, and takes him flying at night. When morning comes and the squirrel goes to sleep, Wormy is stuck in a tree, and Owly, who failed his childhood flying lessons, doesn't know what to do. When Wormy jumps and is hurt, the squirrel saves his new friend and, seeing Owly's genuine concern for Wormy, reconsiders his fear of owls and offers to teach Owly to fly. Runton hits the mark again with this charming tale of confronting and overcoming fears. His expressive, animated black-and-white art breathes life into the lovable characters in a way that will appeal to readers both younger and older than the target age group. <i>Tina Coleman</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Falsely accused of treason, the young sailor Edmond Dants is arrested on his wedding day and imprisoned on an island fortress. After years of solitary confinement in a cramped, dank dungeon, he befriends an Italian prisoner who, with his dying breath, reveals the location of a vast treasure on the island of Monte Cristo. Dants stages a daring and dramatic escape, retrieves this fabulous fortune, and returns to France to exact revenge on his enemies, posing as the Count of Monte Cristo. Dants pursues his vengeance to the bitter end, only then realizing that he himself is a victim of fate. This newly revised, unabridged translation is as unputdownable now as it was when the novel first appeared.

As Virginia and Alden Vaughan show, in their wide-ranging new edition of this established favourite, such antithetical extremes exemplify the play�&#39;s endlessly arguable nature, its appeal to diverse eras and cultures. The Vaughans situate The Tempest at the centre of changing cultural attitudes towards colonialism, power politics and patriarchal hierarchies, and demonstrate how the play both shaped and reflected those changing attitudes. Informed by the concerns of a post-colonial international community, their edition emphasizes the play&#39;s world-wide cultural appropriation, and includes an extensive discussion of the play&#39;s after-life as well as an appendix of selected appropriations. The interdisciplinary editorial approach contributes a distinctively blended cultural and historical focus. �&#39;The Vaughans have provided a valuable new edition of the play, one whose expanded contextualisation, especially, will contribute to The Tempest�&#39;s lively and varied afterlife both within and beyond the classroom.�&#39; Barbara Fuchs, University of Washington, Seattle, Shakespeare Quarterly</p><p>John Dover Wilson&#39;s New Shakespeare, published between 1921 and 1966, became the classic Cambridge edition of Shakespeare&#39;s plays and poems until the 1980s.

When Isabel Archer, a beautiful, spirited American, is brought to Europe by her wealthy aunt Touchett, it is expected that she will soon marry. But Isabel, resolved to enjoy the freedom that her fortune has opened up and to determine her own fate, does not hesitate to turn down two eligible suitors. Then she finds herself irresistibly drawn to Gilbert Osmond. Charming and cultivated, Osmond sees Isabel as a rich prize waiting to be taken. Beneath his veneer of civilized behaviour, Isabel discovers cruelty and a stifling darkness. In this portrait of a 'young woman affronting her destiny', Henry James created one of his most magnificent heroines, and a story of intense poignancy. <br><br> This edition of <i>The Portrait of a Lady</i>, based on the earliest published copy of the novel, is the version read first and loved by most readers in James's lifetime. It also contains a chronology, further reading, notes and an introduction by Philip Horne.&nbsp;<br><br>For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world. With more than 1,700 titles, Penguin Classics represents a global bookshelf of the best works throughout history and across genres and disciplines.

Extensive textual variants provide complete collation of all published versions since its first appearance in serial form through the New York edition of 1908.Actress Nina Foch, who performs this story has played leading roles in many films that have become American classics, including Executive Suite, The Ten Commandments, An American in Paris, and Spartacus.</p><h2>Patterns in Nature: Why the Natural World Looks the Way It Does</h2><p>Though at first glance the natural world may appear overwhelming in its diversity and complexity, there are regularities running through it, from the hexagons of a honeycomb to the spirals of a seashell and the branching veins of a leaf. Revealing the order at the foundation of the seemingly chaotic natural world,<i> Patterns in Nature </i>explores not only the math and science but also the beauty and artistry behind nature&#x2019;s awe-inspiring designs.<br><br> Unlike the patterns we create in technology, architecture, and art, natural patterns are formed spontaneously from the forces that act in the physical world. Very often the same types of pattern and form &#x2013; spirals, stripes, branches, and fractals, say&#x2014;recur in places that seem to have nothing in common, as when the markings of a zebra mimic the ripples in windblown sand. That&#x2019;s because, as <i>Patterns in Nature </i>shows, at the most basic level these patterns can often be described using the same mathematical and physical principles: there is a surprising underlying unity in the kaleidoscope of the natural world. Richly illustrated with 250 color photographs and anchored by accessible and insightful chapters by esteemed science writer Philip Ball, <i>Patterns in Nature</i> reveals the organization at work in vast and ancient forests, powerful rivers, massing clouds, and coastlines carved out by the sea.<br> &nbsp;<br> By exploring similarities such as those between a snail shell and the swirling stars of a galaxy, or the branches of a tree and those of a river network, this spectacular visual tour conveys the wonder, beauty, and richness of natural pattern formation.</p><p>A renowned science writer, <b>Philip Ball</b> lives in London. He worked for over twenty years as an editor for <i>Nature</i>, writes regularly in the scientific and popular media, and has authored many books on the interactions of the sciences, the arts, and the wider culture. His most recent books include <i>Invisible</i>: <i>The Dangerous Allure of the Unseen </i>and <i>Serving the Reich: The Struggle for the Soul of Physics under Hitler</i>."The most beautiful book of 2016." (<i>Publishers Weekly</i>)<br><br>"This cofee-table book showcases the spots, stripes, spirals, and fractals and other intricate patterns found in the natural world." (<i>Live Science</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;From tigers&#x2019; stripes to the hexagons that make up honeycombs to the ripples in windblown sand, the natural world is full of order and regularity. Science writer Ball investigates the phenomenon in his new book, <i>Patterns in Nature</i>, with 250 photographs of snowflakes, shells, and more. Nature&#x2019;s patterns follow basic principles of mathematics and physics, leading to similarities in the stripes, spirals, branches and fractals around us. &#x2018;There&#x2019;s an abundance of detail in nature that we can&#x2019;t see,&#x201d; he says. &#x201c;Even in what seems unstructured, there&#x2019;s pattern.&#x2019;&#x201d;<br> &nbsp; (<i>Wall Street Journal</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Acclaimed English science writer Ball curates a visually striking, riotously colorful photographic display of the most dramatic examples of the &#x2018;sheer splendor&#x2019; of physical patterns in the natural world. He lightly ties the work together with snippets of scientific history, using bits of physics, chemistry, and mathematics to show that although patterns in living beings can offer clear, functional evolutionary advantages, the small set of design elements that we can see&#x2014;symmetries, branching fractals, spirals, flowing swirls, spots, and stripes&#x2014;come from a basic set of organizing properties of growth and equilibrium seeking. . . . This is formidable eye candy for the I-love-science crowd, sure to spark a sense of impressed wonder at the beauty of our universe and our ability to photograph it.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp; (<i>Publishers Weekly</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;This captivating book is a collection of stunning photographs that capture frequently repeating mathematical patterns in nature. These images depict patterns in living things, from pollen to animals, and in non-living things, from lightning to landscapes. Images are accompanied by brief, but clear, explanations for how these patterns can be generated by Fibonacci ratios, suggesting they result from simple self-organization. Excellent coffee table companion to the author&#x2019;s earlier <i>Nature&#x2019;s Patterns: A Tapestry in Three Parts</i> series, which describe in detail how physics and chemistry influence and interweave with evolution (biology) to create patterns and symmetry in nature. This book is a visual feast that can serve as a source of wonder and inspiration for artists and naturalists as well as scientists.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp; (<i>Forbes</i>)</p><h2>The Maxwell Leadership Bible</h2><p><p>The people, events, and teachings of the Bible are a treasury of wisdom and guidance for anyone who has been called to be a leader, to develop leaders, or to work with leaders-in church, business, commerce, or anyplace else. <i>The Maxwell Leadership Bible</i> shows us what God's Word has to say to people of all kinds about leaders and leadership.

Black and white dominos make up each number on various bold backgrounds and each page gives the various properties of numbers zero to twelve. With a simple but imaginative approach, Lynette Long, has created a perfect classroom resource that teaches kids how to add up each dot on an individual domino as well as how to spot different number combinations. This bright and fun-filled introduction to basic addition will appeal to both eager and reluctant math students.</p><p>Lynette Long, Ph.D., has more than twenty years of experience working with children and in education. She has appeared on over 200 television and radio programs, including &#34;Good Morning America&#34; and the &#34;CBS Evening News.&#34; Lynette&#39;s love for dominoes comes from a childhood of playing the game with her extended family in the apartment building they shared in the South Bronx. She splits her time between homes in Maryland and Florida with her two teenagers.Kindergarten-Grade 2-Long uses illustrations of dominoes on colored double-page spreads to introduce the principles of addition. Each opening is the same: "Add the number of spots on the top half of each domino to the number of spots on the bottom half of each domino." This pattern follows from 0 through 12, with the appropriate numbers on the featured pieces. Although there's not much in the way of narrative explanation, the concept is presented clearly. The lack of variance in the text becomes a little monotonous, however-after one sitting, readers won't have to use the book anymore-they'll be able to quote it all from memory. Also, the only domino sets mentioned are those with double sixes-but double nines and twelves are also readily available.

It presents to readers the basic information necessary for more advanced processing and design books. <b></b> Focuses mainly on the basic processes used in fabrication, including lithography, oxidation, diffusion, ion implementation, and thin film deposition. Covers interconnection technology, packaging, and yield. <b></b> Appropriate for readers interested in the area of fabrication of solid state devices and integrated circuits. </p></p><p><p> <i>Introduction to Microelectronic Fabrication, Second Edition,</i> by Richard C. Jaeger, is a concise survey of the most up-to-date techniques in the field. It is devoted exclusively to processing and is highlighted by careful explanations, clean, simple language, and numerous fully solved example problems. </p> <p> The second edition includes an entirely new chapter on MEMS, as well as substantial modifications to the chapters on MOS and bipolar process integration. Also included is new or expanded coverage of lithography and exposure systems, trench isolation, chemical mechanical polishing, shallow junctions, transient enhanced diffusion, copper Damascene processes and process simulation. </p><p> The spectacular advances in the development and application of integrated circuit (IC) technology have led to the emergence of microelectronics process engineering as an independent discipline. Additionally, the pervasive use of integrated circuits requires a broad range of engineers in the electronics and allied industries to have a basic understanding of the behavior and limitations of ICs. One of the goals of this book is to address the educational needs of individuals with a wide range of backgrounds. </p> <p> This text presents an introduction to the basic processes common to most IC technologies and provides a base for understanding more advanced processing and design courses. In order to contain the scope of the material, we deal only with material related to silicon processing and packaging. The details of many problems specifically related to VLSI/ULSI fabrication are left to texts on advanced processing, a4ough problem areas are mentioned at various points in this text, and goals of the international Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors are discussed as appropriate. </p> <p> Chapter 1 provides an overview of IC processes, and Chapters 2-6 then focus on the basic steps used in fabrication, including lithography, oxidation, diffusion, ion implantation and thin film deposition, and etching. Interconnection technology, packaging, and yield are covered in Chapters 7 and 8. It is important to understand interactions between process design, device design, and device layout. For this reason, Chapter 9 and 10 on MOS and bipolar process integration have been included. Chapter 11 provides a brief introduction to the exciting area of Microelectromechanical Systems (MEMS). </p> <p> Major changes in the second edition of this text include new or expanded coverage of lithography and exposure systems, trench isolation, chemical mechanical polishing, shallow junctions, transient-enhanced diffusion, copper Damescene processes, and process simulation. The chapters on MOS and bipolar process integration have been substantially modified, and the chapter on MEMS is entirely new. The problem sets have been expanded, and additional information on measurement techniques has been included. </p> <p> The text evolved from notes originally developed for a course introducing seniors and beginning graduate students to the fabrication of solid-state devices and integrated circuits. A basic knowledge of the material properties of silicon is needed, and we use Volume I of this Series as a companion text. An introductory knowledge of electronic components such as resistors, diodes, and MOS and bipolar transistors is also useful. </p> <p> The material in the book is designed to be covered in one semester. In our case, the microelectronics fabrication course is accompanied by a corequisite laboratory.

Aytch: A Confederate Memoir of the Civil War</h2><p><p> Early in May 1861, twenty-one-year-old Sam R. Watkins of Columbia, Tennessee, joined the First Tennessee Regiment, Company H, to fight for the Confederacy. Of the 120 original recruits in his company, Watkins was one of only seven to survive every one of its battles, from Shiloh to Nashville. Twenty years later, with a "house full of young 'rebels' clustering around my knees and bumping about my elbows," he wrote this remarkable account of "Co. Aytch" -- its common foot soldiers, its commanders, its Yankee enemies, its victories and defeats, and its ultimate surrender on April 26, 1865. </p><p> <i>Co. Aytch</i> is the work of a natural storyteller who balances the horror of war with an irrepressible sense of humor and a sharp eye for the lighter side of battle. Among Civil War memoirs, it is considered a classic -- a living testament to one man's enduring humanity, courage, and wisdom in the midst of death and destruction.</p></p><p>Samuel &#34;Sam&#34; Rush Watkins (June 26, 1839 - July 20, 1901) was a noted Confederate soldier during the American Civil War. He is known today for his memoir Company Aytch: Or, a Side Show of the Big Show, often heralded as one of the best primary sources about the common soldier&#39;s Civil War experience. Watkins was born on June 26, 1839 near Columbia, Maury County, Tennessee, and received his formal education at Jackson College in Columbia. He originally enlisted in the &#34;Bigby Greys&#34; of the 3rd Tennessee Infantry in Mount Pleasant, Tennessee, but transferred shortly thereafter to the First Tennessee Infantry, Company H (the &#34;Maury Greys&#34;) in the spring of 1861. Watkins faithfully served throughout the duration of the War, participating in the battles of Shiloh, Corinth, Perryville, Murfreesboro (Stones River), Shelbyville, Chattanooga, Chickamauga, Missionary Ridge, Resaca, Adairsville, Kennesaw Mountain (Cheatham Hill), New Hope Church, Zion Church, Kingston, Cassville, Atlanta, Jonesboro, Franklin, and Nashville. Of the 120 men who enlisted in &#34;Company H&#34; in 1861, Sam Watkins was one of only seven alive when General Joseph E. Johnston&#39;s Army of Tennessee surrendered to General William Tecumseh Sherman in North Carolina April, 1865. Of the 1,200 men who fought in the First Tennessee, only 65 were left to be paroled on that day. Soon after the war ended, Watkins began writing his memoir, entitled &#34;Company Aytch: Or, a Side Show of the Big Show&#34;. It was originally serialized in the Columbia, Tennessee Herald newspaper. &#34;Co. Aytch&#34; was published in a first edition of 2,000 in book form in 1882. &#34;Co. Aytch&#34; is heralded by many historians as one of the best war memoirs written by a common soldier of the field. Sam&#39;s writing style is quite engaging and skillfully captures the pride, misery, glory, and horror experienced by the common foot soldier. Watkins is often featured and quoted in Ken Burns&#39; 1990 documentary titled The Civil War. Watkins died on July 20, 1901 at the age of sixty-two in his home in the Ashwood Community.

Scenes of a cozy medieval village and a romantic landscape are abruptly breached by the advent of the Jabberwock, a hideous apparition loosely based on Tenniel's original. The double-page confrontation, as readers peer into its lurid, gaping throat, is nightmarish, but the hero swiftly dispatches the monster and rides home. The village is now inexplicably in ruins, while the king on his throne appears unchanged. This discrepancy will probably interest children less than the small anachronisms scattered throughout the illustrations, or the sub-Martian fauna lurking in the riotous flora. (These biological oddities are a lot more convincing than the illustrations of the horse, tack, or rider, in which the artist seems to have been more intent on imagination than observation.) Less inventive and visually aggressive than Animalia , Jabberwocky' s heroic-psychedelic interpretation may not be definitive but will introduce Carroll's classic to new readers. --Patricia Dooley, Univ . of Washington, Seattle<br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.Base's considerable interpretive talents, on full display in Animalia , are featured in this wildly inventive version of "Jabberwocky" from Through the Looking Glass. The lilting phonetic texture of the poem is perfectly enhanced by Base's dramatic full-color paintings. The primeval forest, fairly bursting from the pages with steamy vegetation of every description, is a fitting home for the variety of incredible creatures that dwell within. Jabberwock, Jubjub and Bandersnatch are fully and uniquely hewn from the artist's imagination. "Slithy Toves" becomes two endearing little green creatures that look like a cross between prehistoric animals and beings recently arrived from another planet. The warring elements of this fantastic adventure are dichotomously conveyed: bleary-eyed, razor-toothed, with sharp tentacles, the Jabberwock swoops menacingly, a true embodiment of villainous horror, while the fair-haired prince, thoughtful and courageous on his milk-white steed, is by contrast good and pure. Overflowing with mythic splendor, this compelling version of the Jabberwocky should prove enduring. All ages. <br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Complete Flooring</h2><p><ul><li> This in-depth guide covers every type of residential flooring: laminates, tile, wood, engineered wood, stone, rugs, carpet, garage-tile systems, and polished concrete.<p>More than 600 photos and 75+ illustrations. </p><p></p></li><li> Tips on choosing the best flooring for different rooms and information on how comparing the types helps homeowners make decisions they'll be happy with.<p></p></li><li> Complete step-by-step information on how to install, maintain, and repair each type of flooring helps homeowners evaluate the pros and cons of each type and decide whether their skills are sufficient.<p></p></li><li> Instructions on how to finish or refinish wood floors show homeowners how to get professional results.</li></ul><p></p></p><p></p><h2>Drawing: A Contemporary Approach (with InfoTrac)</h2><p>The number one, best-selling drawing text in the market, DRAWING: A CONTEMPORARY APPROACH goes beyond conventional approaches, emphasizing the emotional, intellectual, spiritual, and social significance of art.

His career as an author was only about 15 years old when he compiled this volume in 1965 for the prestigious Vintage imprint. Like the vast majority of his collections, it has never been out of print. Bradbury's own selection of "his best" is also intriguing because most of the stories chosen are from the beginning of his career, and most are quite hauntingly sad. "The Illustrated Man" relates the ultimate fate of the tattooed title character from the novel of the same name. "The Fog Horn" is the tragic love story of a dinosaur who believes the horn's wail is actually that of his lost mate. "Hail and Farewell" tells of a 43-year-old man who is fated to never look older than 12. Although later upstaged by the truly definitive <i>The Stories of Ray Bradbury</i>, this remains a fitting introduction to one of the world's great fantasists and prose stylists. <i>--Stanley Wiater</i>Once upon a time people described Ray Bradbury as a particularly gifted writer of science fiction.

The book draws a fascinating picture of the deep links between the cultures across the Mediterranean and explores the ways in which these civilizations continue to be influential to this day. Beginning with the emergence of the earliest Egyptian civilization around 3500 BC, Charles Freeman follows the history of the Mediterranean over a span of four millennia to AD 600, beyond the fall of the Roman empire in the West to the emergence of the Byzantine empire in the East. The author examines the art, architecture, philosophy, literature, and religious practices of each culture, set against its social, political, and economic background. Especially striking are the readable and stimulating profiles of key individuals throughout the ancient world, covering persons like Homer, Horace, the Pharaoh Akhenaten, and Alexander the Great. The second edition incorporates new chapters on the ancient Mediterranean and the Ancient Near East, as well as extended coverage of Egypt. <em>Egypt, Greece and Rome</em> is a superb introduction for anyone seeking a better understanding of the civilizations of the ancient Mediterranean and their legacy to the West.</p><p><br><strong>Charles Freeman</strong> has taught ancient history in Cambridge's Adult Education program and leads study tours of Italy for the Historical Association. He is the author of <em>The Closing of the Western Mind: The Rise of Faith and the Fall of Reason</em>.<br>This is the second edition of what was an excellent book in its first edition, and is now stronger and even more useful ... If you did not add the first edition to your school or college library, I recommend that you do so. If you did, the second edition should still beckon you to include it. The Journal of Classics Teaching When Deborah James reviewed the first edition of this book for JACT in 1997 she said &#34;it beats with the pulse of modern scholarship on the ancient Mediterranean&#34; and drew attention among other merits to the way in which the presentation of the great civilizations in this book enabled the reader to view events in context. This remains one of the great strengths of the book, and with this strength there goes the author&#39;s ability to write with skill, precision and vividness for a wide audience. The Journal of Classics Teaching</p><h2>An Anchor for the Soul: Help for the Present, Hope for the Future</h2><p><p>People have honest doubts and questions about God that deserve solid answers. How do we explain the gospel of Jesus Christ in a way we can all&nbsp;understand? Ray Pritchard has updated this best-selling presentation of the gospel in a clear, straightforward way, using simple language and clear Scripture references. <br><br><i>An Anchor for the Soul </i>is written with doubters, seekers, and skeptics in mind, adressing questions like: </p><ul><li>What is God like? </li><li>How can I know Him? </li><li>Who is Jesus, and what did He do? </li><li>What does it mean to be a Christian? </li></ul><p>Through stories and illustrations, pastor Pritchard gently and personally challenges his readers with the good news of Jesus Christ. </p></p><p>We are made to know God, and something in us desperately wants to know Him. We are incurably religious by nature. That's why every human society-no matter how primitive-has some concept of a higher power, some vision of a reality that goes beyond the natural. On one level, that explains why science has not eradicated religion from the earth. Science can never do that because technological achievement can't meet the deepest needs of the human heart. That explains why millions of people read their horoscopes every morning and millions more call psychic hotlines. <p>We want to know the answers to the three most basic questions of life. Where did I come from? Why and I here? Where am I going? And we will spend money, buy books, listen to tapes, attend seminars, and travel great distances to find the answers. Several years ago a book claiming to report one woman's after-death visit to heaven climbed to the top of the best-seller list. Recently another book purporting to find hidden messages in the Hebrew text of the Old Testament sold hundreds of thousands of copies. People are hungry for spiritual truth, and if they cannot find it by normal means, they will reach for anyone or anything that claims to give them an answer. </p><p>It is the same wherever you travel. Superficially we are very different in our appearance, background, language, and customs. But scratch deeper, and you discover that all people are substantially the same. Once past the surface, you discover no fundamental difference between a person born in poverty in Haiti and a corporate lawyer on Wall Street; or between a schoolteacher in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, and a computer scientist in Singapore. Everywhere we are the same-with the same need to love and be loved; with the same desire to be remembered after we die; and with the same sense that there must be a God of some kind who made us. </p><p>We were made to know God, and we need to know Him. God made us to know Him. He designed us so that we would want to know Him-and then He guaranteed we wouldn't be happy unless He Himself fills the void within. This brings us face-to-face with the famous statement that there is a "God-shaped vacuum" inside each person. We may turn to God, or we may fill the vacuum with idols of our own making or the evil spirits of our ancestors. Something in us drives us to seek ultimate meaning. That "something" inside us is put there by God. Augustine gave us this oft-quoted prayer: "You have made us for yourself, and our hearts are restless until they find their rest in you."</p><p><b><i>Where did I come from?<br>Why am I here?<br>Where am I going?<br><br></i></b>These are the deepest questions people ask.&nbsp; And often they suspect the answers have something to do with God: Is He real?&nbsp; What is He really like?&nbsp; Is it possible to have a personal relationship with Him?&nbsp; Can He answer my deepest questions?<br><br>"This book is written for those who want to know God," says Ray Pritchard.&nbsp; "If that describes you, then I have some good news for you: it is possible to know God deeply and personally...and to experience His power in your life."<br><br><i>An Anchor for the Soul </i>is a straightforward, easily readable book--the perfect introduction for those just beginning their Christian journey, or for those considering new steps towards God.<br><br>This book helps answer the toughest questions...and gives hope for a new kind of future.</p></p><h2>Robotics Through Science Fiction: Artificial Intelligence Explained Through Six Classic Robot Short Stories (The MIT Press)</h2><p>Six classic science fiction stories and commentary that illustrate and explain key algorithms or principles of artificial intelligence.</p><p>Robin R.

This book is positive and assertive without being frightening. It lets young children know that it's all right for them to choose when, and by whom, they are to be touched. It goes on to define "private parts" as "the places on your body covered by a bathing suit," and states that they should never be touched by people other than medical personnel and adults helping with bathroom functions. The prefatory note to parents is an important one as it reminds them to trust a child's instincts and concerns related to unwanted touching.

King</b><br> &nbsp;<br> The most famous of the Sherlock Holmes stories, <i>The Hound of the Baskervilles </i>features the phantom dog of Dartmoor, which, according to an ancient legend, has haunted the Baskervilles for generations. When Sir Charles Baskerville dies suddenly of a heart attack on the grounds of the family&#x2019;s estate, the locals are convinced that the spectral hound is responsible, and Holmes is called in. &#x201c;Conan Doyle triumphed and triumphed deservedly,&#x201d; G. K. Chesterton wrote, &#x201c;because he took his art seriously, because he lavished a hundred little touches of real knowledge and genuine picturesqueness on the police novelette.&#x201d;</p><p>We owe 1902's <i>The Hound of the Baskervilles</i> to Arthur Conan Doyle's good friend Fletcher "Bobbles" Robinson, who took him to visit some scary English moors and prehistoric ruins, and told him marvelous local legends about escaped prisoners and a 17th-century aristocrat who fell afoul of the family dog. Doyle transmogrified the legend: generations ago, a hound of hell tore out the throat of devilish Hugo Baskerville on the moonlit moor. Poor, accursed Baskerville Hall now has another mysterious death: that of Sir Charles Baskerville. Could the culprit somehow be mixed up with secretive servant Barrymore, history-obsessed Dr. Frankland, butterfly-chasing Stapleton, or Selden, the Notting Hill murderer at large? Someone's been signaling with candles from the mansion's windows. Nor can supernatural forces be ruled out. Can Dr. Watson--left alone by Sherlock Holmes to sleuth in fear for much of the novel--save the next Baskerville, Sir Henry, from the hound's fangs?<p> Many Holmes fans prefer Doyle's complete short stories, but their clockwork logic doesn't match the author's boast about this novel: it's "a real Creeper!" What distinguishes this particular <i>Hound</i> is its fulfillment of Doyle's great debt to Edgar Allan Poe--it's full of ancient woe, low moans, a Grimpen Mire that sucks ponies to Dostoyevskian deaths, and locals digging up Neolithic skulls without next-of-kins' consent. "The longer one stays here the more does the spirit of the moor sink into one's soul," Watson realizes. "Rank reeds and lush, slimy water-plants sent an odour of decay ... while a false step plunged us more than once thigh-deep into the dark, quivering mire, which shook for yards in soft undulations around our feet ... it was as if some malignant hand was tugging us down into those obscene depths." Read on--but, reader, watch your step! <i>--Tim Appelo</i></p>For generations the curse had hung over the Baskerville family. Now another life had been claimed by the mysterious and terrifying beast. Was it a demon or an animal lurking on the descolate moor? Would the new master of the Baskerville home be its next victim?<p></p><p>Sherlock Holmes and Watson set out to solve the most bewildering and bloodcurdling case of their careers in this world-famous classic of mystery and suspense.</p></p><h2>The Catholic One Year Bible</h2><p>Tyndale House Publishers/Our Sunday Visitor Publishing Division Softcover (approx. size: 5 1/4&#34; x 8&#34; x 1 1/2&#34; deep.) - Arranged in 365 Daily Readings THE LIVING BIBLE A Thought-for-Thought Translation with Deuterocanonical Books. - Also Includes an Easy Two-Year Reading Plan.</p><p></p><h2>The Four Chinese Classics: Tao Te Ching, Chuang Tzu, Analects, Mencius</h2><p>The books collected in this volume represent the first time since the mid-nineteenth century that the four seminal masterworks of ancient Chinese thought have been translated as a unified series by a single translator. Hinton's award-winning experience translating a wide range of ancient Chinese poets makes these books sing in English as never before. But these new versions are not only inviting and immensely readable, they also apply much-needed consistency to key philosophical terms in these texts, lending structural links and philosophical rigor heretofore unavailable in English. Breathing new life into these originary classics, Hinton's new translations will stand as the definitive texts for our era.<br><br>Perhaps the most broadly influential spiritual text in human history, Lao Tzu's <i>Tao Te Ching</i> is the source of Taoist philosophy, which eventually developed into Ch'an (Zen) Buddhism. Equally influential in the social sphere, Confucious' <i>Analects</i> is the source of social wisdom in China. The <i>Chuang Tzu</i> is the wild and wacky prose complement to the <i>Tao Te Ching</i>. And with its philosophical story-telling, the <i>Menicius</i> adds depth and complexity to Confucius' vision.</p><p><b>David Hinton</b> has been awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship, numerous fellowships from the National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities, and both of the major awards given for poetry translation in the United States: the Landon Translation Award, and the PEN Translation Award.

Curtis And The North American Indian</h2><p><p> One hundred years ago, Edward Sheriff Curtis began a thirty-year odyssey to photograph and document the lives and traditions of the Native peoples of North America. This monumental project was hailed by <i>The New York Herald</i> as "the most gigantic undertaking since the making of the King James edition of the Bible." </p><p> In this landmark volume, almost 200 of the finest examples of Cu rt is's photographs are reproduced with startling fidelity to his original prints. Produced to the very highest standards, <i>Sacred Legacy</i> presents Curtis's work without compromise for the first time in the modern era. Taken together, these profound images constitute no less than the core and essence of his life's work. Until now, virtually none of Curtis's photographs have been reproduced in a manner that captures the clarity and richness of his original master prints. In <i>Sacred Legacy,</i> his greatest images are reproduced from the finest source materials available -- a significant number from breathtaking platinum, gold, and silver prints. All have been carefully selected for pub lication and for an accompanying international exhibition by Curtis authority Christopher Cardozo. </p><p> In an effort to bring a new understanding to Curtis's monumental work, <i>Sacred Legacy</i> was developed according to the organizing principles set forth by the great photographer himself. Following the path la id out in his 20 volume magnum opus, <i>The North American Indian,</i> geographic regions are presented separately and individual tribes within each region are depicted and described. Interspersed between these sections are compelling portrayals of those aspects of life common to all tribes, among them spirituality. ceremony, arts, and the activities of daily life. </p><p> With <i>The North American Indian,</i> Curtis achieved the impossible: an extraordinary 20 -volume set of handmade books composed of nearly 4,000 pages of text and 2,200 images presenting more than 80 of North America's Native nations. Luminous, iconic, and profoundly revealing, the pictures that form the heart of the original project are reproduced here in <i>Sacred Legacy.</i> These extraordinary photographs had an immense impact on the national imagination and continue to shape the way we see Native life and culture. </p><p> <i>Sacred Legacy</i> is a fitting testament to the profound beauty, meaning, and complexity of Indian life and to Edward S. Curtis -- a man whose wisdom, passion, and strength drove him to devote thirty years to capturing the nobility and pride of the Native peoples of North America. The photographs in this brilliant volume represent the most important presentation of Curtis's work since the publication of the first volume of <i>Me North American Indian</i> nearly a century ago.</p></p><p><b>Christopher Cardozo</b> is acknowledged as the world's leading authority on Edward S. Curtis. He is the author of five previous titles on Curtis and has curated, lectured on, and written about his work for nearly three decades. Cardozo was trained as both a lawyer and a photographer and his own photographs of Native peoples have been widely exhibited. He lives in Minneapolis, Minnesota and Aspen, Colorado and owns a gallery in Aspen specializing in the work of Edward S.

Hall, <em>American Anthropologist</em></strong></p><h2>George Platt Lynes: Photographs from the Kinsey Institute</h2><p>A celebration of the fine art photographs by the photographer better known for his fashion photography features reproductions of eighty of his most striking images, including portraits, nudes, and shots from the world of fashion and dance.</p><p>Lynes paid his bills with fashion and portrait photography but is best known today for the work he cared most about--his homoerotic male nudes, which were little known in the 1940s and 1950s when he did them. It's hard to imagine Robert Mapplethorpe's or Bruce Weber's similar work, for example, had it not been for Lynes' precedent. Toward the rather sad end of his life in 1955, a patron came to Lynes--sex researcher Alfred Kinsey, who was eager to collect erotic photography and very interested in Lynes' pictures. Eighty images from the Kinsey Institute collection appear here, some of them male nudes but also portraits and fashion and dance work. Lynes knew how to make a beautiful photograph (his dramatic lighting techniques are breathtaking), and he had a deep sensitivity to human beauty. This well-chosen selection, both gorgeous and explicit (although never as outrageous as Mapplethorpe at his most notorious), includes only two of the photographs in <i>George Platt Lynes Photographs 1931-1955</i> (1982). Essays by Kinsey curator Crump on Lynes' place in the art world and on homoerotic culture provide needed context. <i>Gretchen Garner</i>Lynes gained some fame in the Thirties as a surrealist-associated fashion and dance photograher and for a short time was chief photographer of the Vogue studios. He also produced a large number of nudes. Alfred Kinsey's purchases of hundreds of these negatives and prints supplied a large portion of Lynes's income in the early Fifties, when his commercial assignments dropped off and no market for male nudes existed. In two essays, Crump, curator of the Kinsey archives, does a fine job describing Lynes's professional and personal life and reevaluating the historical significance of Lynes's nudes, rightly claiming "Mapplethorpe's vision owes a great deal more to Lynes than heretofore recognized." Unfortunately, close to half the 80 beautiful, full-page reproductions are of his less-important commercial work, and the majority of nudes are in the more sanitized "sculptural" style, leaving the reader wanting more material to evaluate Lynes's relation to today's homoerotic photographers.

A fabulous yellow diamond becomes the dangerous inheritance of Rachel Verinder. Outside her Yorkshire country house watch the Hindu priests who have waited for many years to reclaim their ancient talisman, looted from the holy city of Somnauth. When the Moonstone disappears the case looks simple, but in mid-Victorian England no one is what they seem, and nothing can be taken for granted.<br> Witnesses, suspects, and detectives each narrate the story in turn. The bemused butler, the love-stricken housemaid, the enigmatic detective Sergeant Cuff, the drug-addicted scientist--each speculate on the mystery as Collins weaves their narratives together. <em>The Moonstone</em> transcends the genre of detective novel or murder mystery, though, and this new edition features a fascinating introduction by John Sutherland which discusses the themes of imperialism, sensationalism and mesmerism.<br><br><strong>About the Series: </strong>For over 100 years <strong>Oxford World's Classics</strong> has made available the broadest spectrum of literature from around the globe.

C. Wyeth: A Biography</h2><p>An American painting dynasty is portrayed in this huge, riveting biography of N. C. Wyeth.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His name summons up our earliest images of the beloved books we read as children. His illustrations for Scribner's Illustrated Classics (Treasure Island, Kidnapped, The Last of the Mohicans, The Yearling) are etched into the collective memory of generations of readers. He was hailed as the greatest American illustrator of his day. For forty-three years, starting in 1902, he painted landscapes, still lifes, portraits, and murals as well as illustrations for a long shelf of world literature. Yet he proclaimed "the uselessness of clinging to illustration and hoping to make it a great art." He judged himself a failure, believing that illustration was of no importance.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite the darkness of his temperament, he was a towering figure of gargantuan appetites and physical power. His passions were rooted in the nineteenth century. He made adventure, nature, and "the vastness of things" his earliest personal themes. America was his canvas.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;David Michaelis's biography of N. C. Wyeth tells the story of his family through four generations. It is <br>a family saga that begins and ends with the accidental deaths of small boys, a gothic tale that shows how N.C., while learning to live a safe and familiar domestic life, endangered himself and his children by concealing part of the family legacy--depression, suicide, incest.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We see how his mother's emotional instability and his father's strictness set the stage for his profoundly divided personality. He found in fatherhood the foremost expression of his character--trying to create in the Wyeth homestead his dream of childhood at its most enchanting. He held his children enthralled through their adult lives. He persuaded his inventor son, Nat, to live at home, shepherded his daughter Ann's career as a composer, and taught his three other children--Henriette, Carolyn, and Andrew (N.C. was Andrew's only teacher)--to paint.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The illustrations that N. C. Wyeth undervalued are now regarded as American classics--the paintings that appeared in Treasure Island, Kidnapped, and The Last of the Mohicans are in museums, joining, as John Updike wrote, "the mainstream of American easel painting."<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His work lives. The artist himself is brought alive in David Michaelis's fully realized portrait of this huge-spirited, deeply complicated man, his family, and an America that was quickly vanishing.</p><p>N.C. Wyeth's wondrous paintings of <i>The Last of the Mohicans</i>, <i>Robinson Crusoe</i>, and <i>Treasure Island</i> have given visual form to these stories for generations of readers. Wyeth's extraordinary pictures still carry all the power they had in their heyday. And communal, millennial-bound nostalgia for the first half of the 20th century gives the paintings, if possible, an even more sentimental glow. This meticulous, encompassing study of the tempestuous, difficult, brilliant illustrator also delves into the entire clan of famous Wyeth artists, including Andrew (who was offered a bribe to delay his marriage), and Peter Hurd (who married Andrew's sister Henriette then escaped with her to New Mexico). <p> David Michaelis has done an extraordinary amount of research, and the book should mesmerize Wyeth fans. But he seems to doubt his own ability to make this dramatic material come alive, for he resorts to false suspense--using a baby's death and the suggestion of foul play on page 1 to hook the reader, but nearly 200 pages later allows that there's not really any evidence for his conjectures. And he liberally employs italics, giving the text an insistent tone that is at times intrusive. Nonetheless, Michaelis adroitly chronicles Wyeth's complicated, fraught relationship with his family. And he is especially perceptive in his analysis of N.C.'s stormy ties to his mentor, Howard Pyle. The artist's genteel inability to talk money, even during the Depression; his devotion to his neurotic mother; and the magical world of Chadd's Ford, where he watchfully, jealously raised his children, are all beautifully described. This is a valuable, multifaceted look at a passionate, difficult subject. In the end, Wyeth emerges, warts and all, as a complex individual, whose inner life was thoroughly entwined with every aspect of his art. <i>--Peggy Moorman</i></p>"This extraordinary book restores N.

Now he directs our attention to a new movement in which his own ideas have played a crucial role: effective altruism. Effective altruism is built upon the simple but profound idea that living a fully ethical life involves doing the "most good you can do." Such a life requires an unsentimental view of charitable giving: to be a worthy recipient of our support, an organization must be able to demonstrate that it will do more good with our money or our time than other options open to us. Singer introduces us to an array of remarkable people who are restructuring their lives in accordance with these ideas, and shows how living altruistically often leads to greater personal fulfillment than living for oneself.<br><br><i>The Most Good You Can Do </i>develops the challenges Singer has made, in the <i>New York Times </i>and <i>Washington Post</i>, to those who donate to the arts, and to charities focused on helping our fellow citizens, rather than those for whom we can do the most good. Effective altruists are extending our knowledge of the possibilities of living less selfishly, and of allowing reason, rather than emotion, to determine how we live. <i>The Most Good You Can Do </i>offers new hope for our ability to tackle the world&#x2019;s most pressing problems.</p><p>In a nutshell, what is effective altruism and how does it differ from ordinary charitable giving?<br><br> Effective altruism is both an emerging movement and the set of ideas behind that movement. The basic idea is that to live a fully ethical life, we should seek to do the most good we can. To discover what will do the most good, we need to use reason and evidence. In contrast, two-thirds of donors to charity do no research at all into the organizations to which they donate&#x2014;they are moved by images that play on their emotions, but give no indication whether the organization is effective at what it claims to be doing.<br><br> Aren&#x2019;t we all, at the core, self-interested?<br><br>The book introduces readers to many of the men and women who are practicing effective altruism. What they are doing will startle many readers&#x2014;choosing their careers so that they can donate more, and donating half their incomes to effective charities. Yet typically they don&#x2019;t think of themselves as making a sacrifice. They find their lives more rewarding than they were before they made these choices. So it may not be a question of denying self-interest, but of a different understanding of what really is in one&#x2019;s own interests.&nbsp;<br> Can effective altruism change the world?<br> &nbsp;<br> I find the stories I tell in this book immensely encouraging. There are not many effective altruists yet, but they are already changing the world, and their impact is growing.<b>Peter Singer</b> is Ira W.

He is the author of books and articles in French history and became known to generations of students and teachers as co-author with the late Robert R. Palmer of the widely read college textbook A History of the Modern World, of which the tenth edition was published in 2007. At Duke he served for several years on the executive committee and as chair of the university's elected faculty body, the Academic Council. On extended leave from Duke, he was Director for Humanities at the Rockefeller Foundation in New York from 1974 to 1982, administering a domestic and international program in support of research and teaching in the humanities. After retiring at Duke in 1989, he continued his research and writing, participating in conferences at home and abroad, and serving as lecturer for alumni travel groups in Europe and Asia. Born August 23, 1918, and educated in New York City, to which he remained a frequent visitor, he graduated from Townsend Harris High School in 1933 and 1937 received his B.A. degree from the City College of New York, magna cum laude, with election to Phi Beta Kappa in his junior year and with honors in French and medals in Latin and French. Graduating in the Depression years, he began graduate work in history at Columbia University on a part-time basis while working full time as an assistant in the Registrar's office at the City College. He earned an M.A. degree at Columbia in 1940. Preparing himself also for high school teaching at a time when college teaching positions were scarce, he took a master's degree in education at the City College and taught at the Bronx High School of Science in New York as a teacher in training in 1941-42. Military service in the Second World War interrupted his graduate studies. Serving in the U.S. Armny from August 1942 to June 1946, he was commissioned in 1944 and served overseas as a military intelligence officer in Europe for eighteen months, in combat and in the occupation of Germany. In articles he wrote in 1955 and published in Army History and the Duke Alumni Magazine commemorating the 50th anniversary of the end of the war in Europe he described some of his wartime experiences, including his crossing of the Rhine at the Remagen Bridge in March 1945. After the war he resumed his graduate work, began teaching at Duke in 1947, and received his Ph.D. degree from Columbia in 1950. His first historical publication, Compulsory Labor Arbitration in France, 1936-1939 (Columbia UP, 1951), an outgrowth of his dissertation, received favorable reviews in this country and in Europe. Close to a half century later, in 1999, Osaka University in Japan published a Japanese translation of the monograph in a series described as "notable books on France and Spain in the 1930s." His second book, more broadly focused on the 1930s, was L�on Blum: Humanist in Politics, published by Alfred A. Knopf in 1966, with a French translation following in 1968 published by Fayard, and a second edition and new forward published by Duke University Press in 1987. Alfred Knopf, who took a special interest in the book, reprinted in the then Knopf house organ, teh Borzoi Quarterly, the blooper in the British magazine Encounter that read: "The modern novel has been in a serious crisis ever since James Joyce's monumental effort to narrate a day in the life of Leon Blum." L�on Blum was, of course, not James Joyce's Leopold Bloom but the gifted French intellectual and literary figure in the years before 1914 who came to head the French Socialist party after the First World War. He was France's first Socialist, and first Jewish, premier, heading the Popular Front government in the tumultuous 1930s. In the war years he became a prisoner of Vichy and then of the Nazis but survived to head the French government again briefly before his death in 1950. Charles de Gaulle, who detested all politicians, nonetheless wrote in his memoirs in the early postwar years that if he was compelled to choose anyone as his successor he would select L�on Blum. The Colton biography won the annual North Carolina Mayflower award in 1967, an award for the best nonfiction book published that year by a resident of North Carolina. It received numerous tributes. Professor S. William Halperin, of the University of Chicago, reviewing the book in the American Historical Review in January 1967, described it as "a polished, richly tapestried, and absorbing narrative" and concluded: "I have no hesitation in predicting that it will rank high in twentieth-century historiography." The reviewer in the American Political Science Review in June 1967 called it "solid, comprehensive, and brilliant." Foreign Affairs included the volume in its Fifty Year Bibliography (1972) among its "outstanding books" and "works of scholarship of lasting value" published in the fifty-year period 1920-70. In later years, in April 1988, in a review of the second edition, the French journal Revue de Science Politique described it as "based on a perfect knowledge of the political history of French socialism and a classic from the time of its initial appearance." It has received continuing recognition despite the appearance of more recent studies of Blum. Colton's articles and book reviews have appeared in the American Historical Review, Journal of Modern History, Yale Review, New York Times Book Review, and elsewhere, and he has contributed to numerous encyclopedias and collaborative volumes. For the Time-Life Great Ages of Man series he wrote the volume entitled Twentieth Century, published in 1968, with a second edition in 1980. His collaboration with Palmer on the previously mentioned A History of the Modern World began in 1956 with the book's second edition. Known to generations of undergraduate and graduate studiens as "Palmer and Colton," it was published by Knopf until the closing of its college department in the early 1990s. Since 1992 it has been published by McGraw-Hill (but with Knopf continuing for several years to publish a trade edition for the general public). It traces the history of Europe and the global influence of the West, with close attention to the global context of modern history in the more recent centuries. The book has been used in over 1,000 colleges and universities in the United States and abroad and in advanced placement courses in public and private secondary schools. Over the years it has been translated in its various editions into Arabic, Persian, Swedish, Finnish, Spanish, Italian, and Chinese. A second translation into Chinese of the 10th edition appeared in 2009. In an article on textbooks in the New York Review of Books published February 6, 1987, the distinguished Princeton historian the late Lawrence Stone wrote: "A truly first-rate history textbook, like that of R. R. Palmer and Joel Colton on modern Europe, can shaped the vision of a whole generation and it is there fore very important that the textbooks used in schools and colleges be accurate, up-to-date, fair-minded, intelligent, and written in such a manner as to stimulate curiosity." The New York Times educational supplement, Education Life, on August 2, 1987, included the book in "A List of the Best," a description of nineteen college textbooks in all disciplines "considered classics in their fields." Eric Hobsbawm in his The Age of Extremes: A History of the World, 1914-1991 (1995) referred his readers to its "excellent bibliographies." Even a detective novel found occasion to mention it. Ross Thomas in The Fourth Durango (Mysterious Press, 1989, p. 250) writes that his protagonist, when interrupted by his agitated wife while he is reading in his library, "puts down his book, Palmer and Colton, the fifth edition" to listen to her recounting of the murder she has witnessed. For the two most recent editions of the textbook (9th ed., 2001; 10th ed., 2007) Lloyd Kramer, chair of the History Department at the University of North Carolina, was added as a new co-author after the aged Professor Palmer withdrew; Palmer died in 2002. The authors are now cited as Palmer, Colton, and Kramer. A new Chinese translation of the 10th edition appeared in 2009. In addition to his Guggenheim Fellowship, Mr. Colton's research awards have included fellowships from the Rockefeller Foundation (1961-62) and the National Endowment for the Humanities (1970-71). In 1979 he was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. For distinguished achievement as an alumnus, the City College of New York awarded him a Townsend Harris Medal in 1980. He was one of twelve Phi Beta Kappa National Visiting Scholars appointed for the years 1983-84, shortly after the program was introduced, and in 1984 he was elected to the Fellows of the Phi Beta Kappa Society, an honorary organization supportive of the undergraduate society. He chaired the Phi Beta Kappa chapters at the City colleg of New York and at Duke. In 1985, at the invitation of the German Federal Republic, he participated in a special program in Bonn and Berlin designed to explore the politics, economics, and culture of contemporary Germany. In 1986 he received a Duke University Distinguished Teaching Award. In 1994 he was honored by the Western Society of French History for "exceptional contributions to the study and teaching of French history in the United States." In 2005, the Southern Historical Association's European History Section awarded him on the occasion of its 50th anniversary the Enno Kraehe Distinguished Service Award for his contributions to the teaching and writing of European history and for his service to the Section in its formative years. David Pinkney, president of the American Historical Association in 1980, in his presidential address cited Mr. Colton's work as among those that had led to the French scholar Ren� R�mond's observation in Le Monde: "To Americans we owe some of the best studies of contemporary France." In a paper written for the American Historical Association's centennial meeting in 1984, "a Century of French History in America," R. R. Palmer observed: "American work has been especially successful on subjects which the French themselves find very sensitive to handle, for example, the biography of L�on Blum by Joel Colton and Robert Paxton's books on the Vichy regime." Among other professional activities Mr. Colton has served on the Board of Editors of the Journal of Modern History, French Historical Studies, and Third Republic/Troisi�me R�publique, and on the advisory board of Historical Abstracts. He has also served as chair or as member of committees of the American Historical Association, as vice president of the Society for French Historical Studies, and as chair of the College Entrance Examination Board's European History Advanced Placement Committee. For many years he also worked closely on research and other projects with the International commission on the History of Social Movements and Social Structures headquarterd in Paris, several of whose projects have been published in book form. From 1985 to 1990, he was one of its three international co-presidents. Over the years Joel Colton has taught as a visiting professor at the Unversity of Wisconsin, at Makerere University in Uganda, and at Cadi-Ayyad University in Morocco, and has lectured at T�bingen University in Germany. He has resided for extended periods of time during research leaves in Paris, Geneva, and New York. For many years he was a member of the Century Association in New York and has remained a longtime member of PEN American Center. His wife, whom he married in May 1942, the late Shirley Baron Colton, a New York University alumna and editor, died in December 2003. His daughter, Valerie Woodbury, resides with her family in Durham, North Carolina. His son Kenneth Colton, is a managing director of Lazard Asset Management in New York and resides with his family in Upper Montclair, New Jersey. His five grandchildren are Emelyn Woodbury-Carroll, Marcia and Amy Woodbury, and Clare and Alex Colton. In August 2008, on the occasion of his 90th birthday, Dr. Deborah Jakubs, Director of the Duke Universities Libraries and Vice Provost for Library Affairs, announced the establishment of the Joel and Shirley Colton Fund for European History in honor of Joel and his late wife. In her announcement, Dr. Jakubs cited his "profound impact on the field of European history and on generations of graduate and undergraduate students at Duke and beyond." The Colton Fund will help strengthen and support the existing resources at Duke for study and research in European history.</p><h2>Policy Analysis: Concepts and Practice (5th Edition)</h2><p>Updated in a new 5th edition, this book lays a strong conceptual foundation to understanding the rationales of and limitations to public policy.

Theology is the place and story you think of when you ask yourself about the meaning of your life, of the world, and the possibility of God."</b><br><br>So begins Serene Jones's epic work of raw truth, fierce love, and spiritual teaching as muscular as the fractured soul of this century demands. From her abiding Oklahoma roots to her historic leadership of a legendary New York seminary, her story illuminates the deep fault lines of this age--and points beyond them. With a voice that is at once frank and poetic, humble and prophetic, intimate and practical, Jones makes complex teachings around hatred, forgiveness, mercy, justice, death, sin, and grace understandable and immediately applicable for modern people. Excavating the wisdom of great theological voices--Soren Kierkegaard, Reinhold Niebuhr, John Calvin, James Baldwin, James Cone, Luce Irigaray, Saint Teresa of Avila--she brings them to life with an intimacy and vividness that illumines our lives and our culture now. At the same time, and with great beauty, <i>Call It Grace</i> reveals Serene Jones as a towering voice of a new, and urgently necessary, public theology for this century.</p><p>Serene Jones is the president of the historic Union Theological Seminary in the City of New York. The first woman to head the 180-year-old institution, Jones occupies the Johnston Family Chair for Religion and Democracy. She is the past president of the American Academy of Religion. Jones came to Union after seventeen years at Yale University, where she was the Titus Street Professor of Theology at the Divinity School, and chair of Women's, Gender and Sexuality Studies at Yale University. Jones is the author of several books including <i>Trauma and Grace</i>. She is a child of the Oklahoma plains, a daughter of a university president and a single mother, a sister, a cancer survivor, a theologian, a minister, a news commentator, a public intellectual, and a devoted teacher.<p>Chapter 1</p><p>Prairie Theology</p><p>The grace of God, which dwells in my house, will not leave it desolate.</p><p>John Calvin,</p><p>Institutes of the Christian Religion, 1559</p><p>A large painting of an Oklahoma landscape hangs in my New York living room, as it has hung in each home I've lived in since I left the American plains in 1981. It depicts a solitary oil rig surrounded by scattered pieces of drilling equipment and work trailers. The rig stands tall against an empty field of wheat and a shockingly blue sky. More than once I've realized that it captures something basic about my theology. It shows the immensity and gracefulness of my home place but also captures its paradoxes, crude and uncertain. A human creation, the rig contrasts sharply with the nature that surrounds it, especially the huge cloudless sky that fills most of the painting. John Randolph, a well-known Oklahoma artist, gave this painting to my parents years ago, when we lived in the small town of Enid, in the heart of Garfield County, previously known as the Cherokee Strip, a part of what the federal government called the Oklahoma Territory.<br>The reddish yellow of the prairie and the bright blue sky are so strong that people who aren't from Oklahoma often miss the fact that there's an oil rig in the picture, its unseen pipelines driven deep into the dirt below. No one from Oklahoma misses it, though. Oklahomans who visit my apartment immediately imagine what is going on underground. There's no doubt in their minds but that the large metal figure is busy pumping out black sludge that translates into money. Lots of it. Nowadays, my Oklahoman houseguests can't help but think about the earthquakes caused by these rigs, too. One friend, who told me she sometimes feels several small earthquakes a day in her home there, said that the moment she looked at the painting she saw the landscape fracturing into pieces.<br>A study in what is seen and unseen, the picture is uniquely American: a richly colored story of land, sky, machines, and people and their struggles to find place, power, and wealth. For some, it mattered little how cruel the cost of their struggle would be. For others, mere survival was their only goal, never fame or fortune. Just life. For most, the struggle fell somewhere between the two, their complex lives captured well by the painting's contradictions.<br>It also summons, for me, theology, albeit theology told in a uniquely American way. I call it prairie theology.<br>I was taught this "prairie" version of American theology from the time I could walk. The church where I learned it is not well known today, although during its nineteenth-century glory days it was celebrated as the cutting-edge rebel of American Protestantism. Eventually called the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ), the church started as a social movement designed to unite all Christians through the creation of a nationwide fellowship that transcended the many disparate doctrines and denominational divides that had long cluttered the Protestant landscape. My great-grandparents joined the movement when it first swept across the plains into the Oklahoma Territory in the late 1800s. They liked its simplicity; the pithy slogan "No creed but Christ, no book but the Bible" summed it all up for them.<br>These early Disciples didn't like hierarchies, which meant that clergy were given no pride of place and minimal performative staging on Sunday mornings. Regular people, not special priests, presided over communion services, which consisted of grape juice and bread shared around a spare wooden table every time people gathered. The Disciples were uncomfortable with anything that smelled even slightly like church decorum; they insisted that just like Jesus, God did not care about creeds or liturgies or incense, or for that matter, about social position or racial rank. In God's eyes, everyone was equal.<br>This dogged insistence on equality was applied to salvation as well: everyone-even bad guys-was equally saved. They were unabashed universalists. No salvation ladder hung over our heads, waiting for the most strenuously virtuous of us to grab it and lead the way up to heaven. Salvation wasn't a contest. It consisted of the bare fact that as in life, after we die, God loves us. All of us. There was nothing more to add. The salvation playing field was as flat as an Oklahoma wheat field. Little did I realize how radical this would sound when compared with the punishment/reward theology that still dominates so many American churches.<br>This meant that threats and promises about heaven and hell, that great Protestant pastime, rarely appeared in family conversations or at church. Much heavier emphasis was put on our belief in a God who loved and forgave everyone's sins. Because we so ardently championed forgiveness, it was impossible to imagine why a forgiving God would decide to punish some and save others. Saints and sinners, we were all in the same boat when it came to the ultimate truth about our lives: We were all justified by God's grace alone, which was good news.<br>As for sin, my church steered away from the commonplace American obsession with sexual morality, instead focusing on social injustice and its moral roots in pride and greed. It was as much about public morals as private ones. The challenge of living faithfully, then, was not about being perfect but rather being honest enough to catch yourself when "unloving" feelings or actions reared their nasty heads in your day-to-day interactions. When you saw greed and arrogance running wild in your heart or in the streets, they had to be called out. Our Sunday school lesson books did not include the usual list of personal prohibitions but rather gentle advice on how to better "love your neighbor as yourself." We also learned to keep our eyes on the local political stage for similar attitudes toward others so that, as good Christians, we could live together as equals in a just society, like the early disciples.<br>"No question about it. Jesus teaches the greatest sin of all is racism!" my elderly white Sunday school teacher, Mrs. Walker, explained to our all-white junior-high youth group one Sunday morning as we sat in the overheated trailer that served as our Sunday-morning classroom.<br>"So," she said, "don't let the fact that you are white lead you to think you are special or better." She looked at our barely nodding heads, wrongly assuming no further discussion was needed. It was so typically Disciples-like, to make bold assertions about theology and social justice together and to believe it would make obvious sense to everyone.<br>That Sunday, Reverend Larry preached that "the sin of greed is the greatest of all" as he then moved on to talk about how the early disciples had shared everything, "giving to each according to their need.<br>"I know it's not popular to say so these days, but Jesus's early disciples were"-he leaned forward to confidentially share with the congregation at the end of the sermon-" . . . COMMUNISTS." My kid brain had no idea what "communist" meant. But I got the bigger point. We were supposed to share what we had. For me, that meant giving twenty cents of my weekly dollar allowance to the church as my tithe against poverty.<br>This all made good sense to the movement's early followers, most of them poor and uneducated, many of them social outcasts of one form or another. The theology of these downtrodden believers reminded them always that even though each and every one of them was a sinner, in God's hands they were all forgiven and graced. This sense of all-encompassing love had to make the brutal prairie life-so full of failure, hunger, violence, and hardship-more bearable and explicable. We so often, I later came to realize, find the version of theology that our life needs.<br>Not surprisingly, this theology provided fertile ground for the populist and socialist sentiments that flourished in Oklahoma's early days. "If God thinks we are all the same, then why shouldn't our politicians, too?" was the logic that bound church and state together. In fact, so strong was this bond that in 1914 (just seven years after Oklahoma's official formation) 175 registered socialists were elected to state and local offices, making it the most socialist state in the history of the union. Religious language dominated their campaign messages-"Jesus is a socialist!" was their favored rallying cry. One of Oklahoma's most famous socialists, Woody Guthrie, captured this well when he said, "All my songs blow out of Christ." While such a bond between faith and socialist principles is hardly imaginable in today's public life, the state's founding spirit was economically democratic precisely because it was theologically democratic.<br>In my own childhood experience with this prairie faith and its politics, the equation that "what you believed about God" equals "what you believed about society" was as self-evident as the hard sun above us. If Jesus cares about poor people, so should we. If the prophet Amos loathed greed, then we should make sure resources were shared among us. If Jesus told us to love neighbors and enemies as ourselves, then we should try mightily to do so. And so it went. The God that hovered over this well-ordered world of right and wrong was populist-a God of the people, a friend to the sick and the lost, a lover of the hardscrabbled and downtrodden. And Jesus was right there with us, walking alongside us, giving wise advice on how to live a good life.<br>Later in my life, as I studied theology and learned to look more honestly at my own family's prairie faith, I began to see that it was more complicated than it had seemed to my childhood eyes and ears. I realized there were more gaps in this belief system than immediately appeared, especially when it came to questions about what awaits us at death, how to endure unrelieved suffering, how such populist sentiments could sometimes produce horrendous action, and how to find the strength when your moral convictions are widely rejected. But to the younger me, it was simple. God is love. Jesus is the friend who shows us how to live. So go out and love and try to live like Jesus. If you fail, try harder. But don't worry, for God loves and forgives you regardless. And remember always, at the end of the whirlwind of life, all of us are graced. It helped hold the anxiety and harshness of life on the plains at bay-even for a child a mere generation removed from the most brutal aspects of plains life.</p><p>Sodbusters</p><p>My people were farmers or, as they were dismissively called by city people, "sodbusters." No one embodied what it meant to be a sodbuster better than my paternal grandma, Idabel Augusta Seitz Jones. Her story is classic Oklahoma. Her father, Charles Seitz, was a stern, hardworking farmer who had failed in various endeavors "back east." So when he heard the federal government was giving away free land south of Kansas, he headed west to claim his share. Leaving behind his fianc&#x17d;e, my great-grandmother Effie Gunn, he camped for several weeks on the Kansas border, waiting till September 16, 1893, when the now famous gunshot signaled the start of the free-for-all scramble called the Oklahoma Land Run. There were seven of these runs over a period of about fifteen years, as large tracts of land were slowly sectioned off, some areas originally promised to tribal members who survived the awful Trail of Tears, and before that, most of it home to the displaced Kiowa, Cheyenne, Arapaho, Osage, and Comanche tribes.<br>"My father was the most handsome man in the camp," Idabel would regularly tell me as she sat in her upholstered chair in her dark living room. "He used the money he made from selling his farm to buy the fastest horse in the county. Can't remember that horse's name. But when that shot was fired at dawn to officially start the run, everyone knew that my father, climbing bareback onto that white stallion-he had sold the saddle for food on the way-would be out front. You should have seen him ride. He rode like a banshee, that man," she said. "Sweating as hard as the horse.<br>"My father had already scoped out the plots we wanted near Billings," she told me. "Prime land because it had a creek. He got there first, grabbed the flags with the plot numbers, and was at the land registry office in Enid by late afternoon, claiming their new God-given homestead. He then returned east to marry Effie and bring her back to their new home. They packed a small wagon with dishes and pots, a steel plow, and family Bibles." Looking at those Bibles, my grandma, to her dying day, insisted that those plots were God-given, "our divine calling" to turn its rock-hard red soil into wheat fields.<br>There was never any mention made of the native Osage people who had long roamed those particular plains. To the Seitz family, it was barren and free, as it was to the more than fifty thousand people who claimed two million acres of prairie on the first land run alone. Like many homesteaders' heirs, we still have the Billings farm in our family; it now supports vast fields of wheat and a few oil wells, the latter something Effie and Charles would have never imagined. Together, the oil wells bring in a trickle of money, but the few extra dollars flowing from that black sludge would have been a fortune to them. For us, it's a reminder that we are not innocent bystanders in the industry that made the state and is now destroying it through fracking. We are part of the problem.<br>Before the oil, though, the work of turning prairie into arable soil was backbreaking and soul tearing. They called it "sodbusting" because of the hard-hitting, pounding labor it took to crack the ground's concretelike surface open. "People thought only ignorant poor people would be foolish enough to waste their life busting soil," my grandma said. "But we were proud of our work. And we never made a fuss about anything. Just wanted folks to leave us alone. We lived far from town. We didn't have guns-they were too expensive. And if a family like ours made a scene-getting drunk, gambling, fighting, hiring strangers as farmhands-it never ended well. People would sometimes just disappear. Killed probably, by greedy neighbors or cattlemen passing through. We knew not to ask questions. Just stay quiet and tell ourselves they must have just gone back east, the work was too hard."<br>Quietly, her father eventually worked himself to death. But before he died, he saw golden waves of grain rise up out of his fields. "God's bounty," my grandma called it. That bounty allowed Idabel, her two brothers, Roy and Adam, and two sisters, Carolyn and Effie, to fulfill their mother's dream of going south to college in Norman, Oklahoma, where the territorial legislature had established its first non-land-grant university in 1890, now known as the University of Oklahoma, or, to us then, simply and fondly as OU. That trip to Norman was more than just going away to college. It meant leaving behind their sodbuster childhood, in search of higher things. Idabel never noted how groundbreaking it was for girls in that age to go to college. I have to believe that the example of ordained women ministers in the Disciples of Christ blazed the trail for such a remarkable anomaly. Also, that hard prairie world rendered gender roles mostly irrelevant. She, in a way, was never afforded the luxury-or the burden-of being a "girl."</p></p><h2>Electrical Engineering: Principles &amp; Applications</h2><p><i>For courses in Electrical Engineering.</i> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p> <b>Accessible and applicable learning in electrical engineering for introductory and non-major courses </b> </p> <p>The #1 title in its market, <b> <i>Electrical Engineering: Principles and Applications</i> </b> helps students learn electrical-engineering fundamentals with minimal frustration.

Its practices can be used side-by-side with traditional Western medicine and have been growing steadily in popularity in the U.S. over the past decade. Written by world renowned practitioner Dr. Henry C. Lu, Chinese Natural Cures is a complete and user-friendly guide to the principals and methods of Chinese medicine. Included here are treatments for dozens of ailments and complaints such as body pains, digestive problems, sleep disorders, infertility, and more. An encyclopedic section on herbs includes the classification of all Chinese herbs and their application, and a comprehensive section on the Chinese system of food cures offers vital information on how a wide variety of foods can prevent or cure disease. Dozens of easy-to-follow charts organize all of this invaluable information for reference at a glance.<br><br> This handsomely designed new paperback edition is smaller and handier, and is sure to bring the traditions of Chinese medicine to an even wider audience.</p><p>Henry C. Lu, Ph.D., has been practicing Chinese medicine since 1972, and teaches Chinese medicine all over the world. Dr. Lu&#x2019;s books are recommended by the Board of Acupuncture Examiners in the United States. He currently lives in Vancouver, Canada.Traditional Chinese medicine goes back over 3,000 years. It was not developed by any particular individual; rather, it grew out of the necessity of maintaining good health among the Chinese people. The ancient Chinese, like all of us, had to struggle against diseases in order to stay in good health. In the process, they came to see the benefits of consuming herbs (known as Chinese herbology today), inserting needles in the body (known as Chinese acupuncture today), eating the right foods (known as Chinese food cures today), massaging the body (knows as Chinese manipulative therapy today) and exercising the body (known as qi-gong and tai-ji).<p> Today, traditional Chinese medicine is practiced in China side by side with modern Western medicine. There are as many hospitals of traditional Chinese medicine as modern hospitals of Western medicine. From the Chinese point of view, traditional Chinese medicine is on an equal footing with Western medicine.</p><p> You may ask why we need traditional Chinese medicine when modern, scientific medicine is available to all of us. The reason is that many diseases and ailments that cannot be cured by Western medicine can be treated by traditional Chinese medicine successfully. It is a fact that many patients experience instant relief of pain when treated with Chinese acupuncture, which cannot be achieved by Western medicine. In addition, traditional Chinese medicine has proven superior to Western medicine in the treatment of skin, liver and kidneys diseases, as well as many other diseases.</p><p> Excerpted from Chinese Natural Cures by Henry C.

He went to Trinity College, Dublin and then to Magdalen College, Oxford, where he began to propagandize the new Aesthetic (or &#39;Art for Art&#39;s Sake&#39;) Movement. Despite winning a first and the Newdigate Prize for Poetry, Wilde failed to obtain an Oxford scholarship, and was forced to earn a living by lecturing and writing for periodicals. After his marriage to Constance Lloyd in 1884, he tried to establish himself as a writer, but with little initial success. However, his three volumes of short fiction, The Happy Prince (1888), Lord Arthur Savile&#39;s Crime (1891) and A House of Pomegranates (1891), together with his only novel, The Picture of Dorian Gray (1891), gradually won him a reputation as a modern writer with an original talent, a reputation confirmed and enhanced by the phenomenal success of his Society Comedies - Lady Windermere&#39;s Fan, A Woman of No Importance, An Ideal Husband and The Importance of Being Earnest, all performed on the West End stage between 1892 and 1895. Success, however, was short-lived. In 1891 Wilde had met and fallen extravagantly in love with Lord Alfred Douglas. In 1895, when his success as a dramatist was at its height, Wilde brought an unsuccessful libel action against Douglas&#39;s father, the Marquess of Queensberry. Wilde lost the case and two trials later was sentenced to two years&#39; imprisonment for acts of gross indecency. As a result of this experience he wrote The Ballad of Reading Gaol. He was released from prison in 1897 and went into an immediate self-imposed exile on the Continent. He died in Paris in ignominy in 1900.</p><h2>Elementary Information Security: With Navigate Premier Package</h2><p>Each new print copy includes Navigate 2 Advantage Access that unlocks a comprehensive and interactive eBook, student practice activities and assessments, a full suite of instructor resources, and learning analytics reporting tools.<br><br>Elementary Information Security is certified to comply fully with the NSTISSI 4011: the federal training standard for information security professionals.<br>See a detailed topic matching spreadsheet under the Additional Resources tab below.<br><br>An ideal text for introductory information security courses, the second edition of Elementary Information Security provides a comprehensive yet easy-to-understand introduction to the complex world of cybersecurity and technology.

The only problem is, life seems to be conspiring against her. Cara's implacable father, "The Colonel", doesn't believe in Cara's business savvy and is about to call in his twenty-thousand-dollar loan. Then, on the morning that someone steals her dog, Cara's refrigerator goes on the blink, turning twelve thousand dollars' worth of gorgeous blooms into road kill. And if that's not enough, the dog-napper, Jack Finnerty, turns up at her latest wedding and then mysteriously leaves her stranded on the dance floor. </p><p>All this turmoil will be solved if Cara can pull off the lavish Trappnell-Strayhorn wedding. The payday will solve all her problems&#x2015;even the looming problem of a celebrated florist named Cullen Keane who is moving into her turf from Charleston. But the wedding is in six weeks, the bride is acting strangely (even for a bride) and the stepmother of the bride is becoming Cara's biggest headache. What Cara needs is to focus, but that's not easy when Jack is turning up at every wedding in Savannah (the man seems to know everybody), with Cara in his sights and seduction on his mind. </p><p>When Brooke Trappnell spirals into a shocking crisis and the wedding is in jeopardy, Cara must come to the rescue and figure out what she really believes in. Is it love? Is it her own strength? In the end, for everyone, "Save the Date" has more meanings than one. Told with Mary Kay Andrews's trademark wit and keen eye for detail, <i>Save the Date</i> is one you won't want to miss.</p></p><p>MARY KAY ANDREWS is <i>The New York Times</i> bestselling author of <i>Ladies' Night</i>,<i> Spring Fever</i>, <i>Summer Rental,</i> <i>The Fixer Upper, Deep Dish, Blue Christmas, Savannah Breeze, Hissy Fit, Little Bitty Lies,</i> and <i>Savannah Blues.</i> A former journalist for <i>The Atlanta Journal Constitution, </i>she lives in Atlanta, Georgia.<p>1</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Something was off. Cara Kryzik was no psychic, but the minute her bare feet hit the floor that morning, she sensed it.</p> <p>She sniffed the air apprehensively and was met with the sweet perfume from the tiny nosegay of gardenias&#x2014;her favorites&#x2014;that she&#x2019;d placed in a sterling bud vase on her dresser the night before.</p> <p>Had she overslept? No. The big bells of St. John the Baptist cathedral were ringing the eight-o&#x2019;clock hour as she descended the stairs from her apartment to her shop one floor below.</p> <p>Cara shuffled down the narrow hallway to the front of the darkened flower shop. She flicked on the wall switch, and the multitude of thrift-shop chandeliers she&#x2019;d hung at varying heights from the tall-ceilinged room twinkled to light, their images reflecting from all the mirrors staged around the space. It was a small room, but she thought the chandeliers and mirrors expanded the space visually.</p> <p><i>See?</i> She scoffed at her own foolish sense of foreboding. All was well.</p> <p>She pulled up the shades over the front windows and smiled. It was a bright, sunny Friday morning, and within seconds, her puppy, Poppy, had her nose pressed against the glass-paneled front door, watching a pair of squirrels scamper past on the sidewalk outside on Jones Street.</p> <p>The message-waiting light was blinking on the shop&#x2019;s answering machine. She gave the machine a fond pat. Business had been slow. But it was May. Mother&#x2019;s Day was next Sunday, it was prom season, and wedding season, too. Things were already picking up.</p> <p>And then? She felt a single bead of perspiration trickle down her back. She frowned. Why was it so hot in the shop? Even for Savannah the room seemed stuffy and overheated. Cara went to the thermostat on the wall and squinted, trying to see the reading.</p> <p>She&#x2019;d turned the thermostat up before bed last night, just to 81, hoping to save a little on her always spiraling electricity bill. The air-conditioning unit was temperamental at best, and her landlord was never prompt when it came to making repairs. She had a string of appointments in the shop today, and it wouldn&#x2019;t do to have brides and their mamas stewing in their own juices.</p> <p>She fiddled with the control for a moment, holding her breath, waiting to hear the compressor click to life. When it did, she exhaled. <i>See? All is well.</i></p> <p>Before she could sit down to check her emails, the shop phone rang.</p> <p>She&#x2019;d known who the caller would be. &#x201c;Good morning, Lillian,&#x201d; Cara chirped. &#x201c;How&#x2019;s our bride today? Is she getting jittery?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s still asleep, thank God,&#x201d; Lillian Fanning said. Never one to waste time on pleasantries, Lillian got right down to business. &#x201c;Listen, Cara, I&#x2019;ve been thinking. I know we said white candles for the altar, but with an early-evening wedding, I really believe ivory or ecru would be much more effective.&#x201d;</p> <p>Cara crossed her eyes in exasperation. She&#x2019;d already special-ordered two dozen hand-dipped organic soy <i>white</i> candles for Torie Fanning&#x2019;s wedding tomorrow. But it was useless to tell the mother of the bride that it was impossible to get the candles in a different color at this late date.</p> <p>She heard the bell on the front door jingle and looked up to see her assistant, Bert, let himself in, a large coffee in one hand and his bicycle helmet in the other.</p> <p>&#x201c;Lillian Fanning?&#x201d; He mouthed the words, and Cara nodded. For the past two weeks, Lillian had called Bloom at least twice a day, every day.</p> <p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll see what I can do,&#x201d; Cara said, being deliberately vague.</p> <p>&#x201c;Ecru or ivory, <i>not</i> white,&#x201d; Lillian repeated.</p> <p>Cara sighed. &#x201c;Of course.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;What about the flowers? Did everything get delivered? And you&#x2019;ve got Torie&#x2019;s grandmother&#x2019;s epergne polished for the bride&#x2019;s table?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Everything is absolutely under control,&#x201d; Cara assured Lillian. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve got all the bridesmaids&#x2019; bouquets finished, and I&#x2019;ll start on Torie&#x2019;s this afternoon, so it will be absolutely the freshest possible. And Lillian? I have to say the two of you have made the most exquisite flower choices I&#x2019;ve ever seen in this town.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;I should hope so, for what this wedding is costing us,&#x201d; Lillian Fanning said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll see you at the church tomorrow.&#x201d;</p> <p>Cara hung up and stuck out her tongue at the phone.</p> <p>&#x201c;Is it hot in here, or is it just me?&#x201d; Bert asked, standing in front of the thermostat and fanning himself with an envelope he grabbed off a stack of bills on her desk.</p> <p>&#x201c;I turned it up last night before I went to bed, but I think it&#x2019;s starting to cool down now,&#x201d; Cara said.</p> <p>&#x201c;Well, I&#x2019;m roasting,&#x201d; Bert declared. He looked at her closely. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re not having chills again, are you?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;No! I&#x2019;m fine. I took the last of those darned antibiotics on Tuesday. I can&#x2019;t afford to get sick ever again.&#x201d;</p> <p>Cara took Bert&#x2019;s hand and placed it on her own forehead. &#x201c;See? Cool as a cucumber. No fever, no temp, no problem.&#x201d;</p> <p>But Bert wasn&#x2019;t paying attention. He was staring at the glass door of their flower cooler. Even through the door, beaded as it was with condensation, it was a grim sight.</p> <p>&#x201c;Uh-oh.&#x201d;</p> <p>Cara flung the door of the cooler open. &#x201c;Oh, God.&#x201d;</p> <p>She couldn&#x2019;t believe her eyes. All the flowers in all the buckets in the cooler were limp, dead, dying. Torie Fanning&#x2019;s bridesmaids&#x2019; bouquets, so carefully wrapped in their silk-satin binding, were toast. She glanced at the thermometer hanging from the top shelf and felt like weeping. It had been at 35 degrees last night, before she&#x2019;d gone upstairs. But now it was at 86.</p> <p>She let the door close and pressed her face against the glass. The reassuring hum of the compressor motor was silent.</p> <p>&#x201c;The cooler is dead,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;And so are the flowers. The motor must have conked out sometime overnight.&#x201d;</p> <p>Bert reached for the Rolodex on the desk. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll call the repairman. Didn&#x2019;t he just fix this thing like six weeks ago?&#x201d;</p> <p>Cara nodded glumly. &#x201c;He did. To the tune of three hundred dollars. But he warned me then, he didn&#x2019;t know how long it would keep running. When I opened the shop I bought it off a guy whose pizza place had gone out of business. Turns out this thing is so old, you can&#x2019;t find new parts for it. My guy had to jerry-rig it with secondhand parts he had lying around his shop.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;What are we gonna do?&#x201d;</p> <p>Cara closed her eyes, hoping for inspiration. &#x201c;I have no idea. All I know is, Lillian Fanning will shit a brick if she finds out about this. You heard me, I just promised her we had everything under control. The most demanding bride I&#x2019;ve ever worked with&#x2014;and this had to happen today.&#x201d;</p> <p>She opened the cooler door again and grabbed the nearest bucket. Three dozen long-stemmed white iceberg roses were crammed into it, and their heads drooped like so many sleepy toddlers.</p> <p>&#x201c;Dead.&#x201d; She dropped a handful of roses into the trash and reached for the next bucket, and the next, repeating the diagnosis&#x2014;and throwing them away.</p> <p>When she was done, the big plastic trash bin was full and all that was left on the counter was one bucketful of leatherleaf ferns&#x2014;&#x201c;You can&#x2019;t kill these things, even if you tried,&#x201d; Cara noted&#x2014;and a raggedy assortment of single blossoms that had somehow managed to survive.</p> <p>Bert grabbed one of the pale blue mophead hydrangea blossoms and with his secateurs snipped off the end of the stem. He turned on the faucet in the worktable sink, let the water heat up, then filled an empty bucket with hot water. He plunged the first hydrangea in, and reached for another.</p> <p>&#x201c;We can save these,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll reprocess all of them, strip the leaves, trim the stems. Put some Floralife in the water. They&#x2019;re not all a total loss. I bet they&#x2019;ll perk right back up.&#x201d;</p> <p>Cara kicked at the trash can with the toe of her sandal, wincing in pain as soon as she&#x2019;d done it. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s twelve thousand dollars&#x2019; worth of flowers, gone. Even if we save some of them, there&#x2019;s no way we can even put together a boutonniere out of this mess, let alone enough flowers for Torie, eight bridesmaids, and all the flowers for the church and the reception. And it&#x2019;s too late to get more flowers shipped from California in time for tomorrow.&#x201d;</p> <p>Bert looked around the room, as though a new shipment of flowers might magically appear from thin air.</p> <p>&#x201c;What about the wholesale house? Can&#x2019;t you call them? Or we could run over there and see what they&#x2019;ve got.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Breitmueller&#x2019;s? On a Friday morning in May? With all the weddings and proms going on around town? They&#x2019;ll be picked clean by now. Anyway, they don&#x2019;t carry the kinds of flowers we promised Torie. Lilies of the valley? Ranunculus? Casablanca lilies? Peonies?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;What about Lamar?&#x201d; Bert asked. &#x201c;I know we usually see him on Thursdays, but maybe, if you called and told him what happened&#x2026;&#x201d;</p> <p>Cara blinked back tears. &#x201c;Lamar&#x2019;s clear up in Atlanta, Bert. He&#x2019;s not gonna come all the way down here just to save my bacon.&#x2026;&#x201d;</p> <p>Bert pointed at the phone. &#x201c;C&#x2019;mon, Cara. That old man loves you. He might make a special trip, if you explained what was at stake.&#x201d;</p> <p>Cara shrugged and reached for her Rolodex. But before she could flip to Lamar&#x2019;s card, the shop phone rang.</p> <p>She picked up the phone and looked at the caller ID, and her hand froze. The area code was one she knew by heart: 614 for Columbus, Ohio. And, of course, the caller was one she knew all too well, too.</p> <p>She should let the call roll over to voicemail. Ignore it. He&#x2019;d only call back, and keep calling until she picked up. Her day couldn&#x2019;t get much worse now. So why put off the inevitable?</p> <p>Cara swallowed hard and tapped the receive button.</p> <p>&#x201c;Hi, Dad.&#x201d;</p> <p>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p> <p>&#x201c;Cara? Are you all right?&#x201d; Her father&#x2019;s voice boomed so loudly she had to hold the phone several inches from her ear. Lieutenant Colonel Paul Kryzik&#x2019;s idea of a whisper was more like a shout to most people.</p> <p>&#x201c;Fine, Dad. How are you?&#x201d;</p> <p>Cara felt a knot forming in the pit of her stomach. She knew exactly why the Colonel was calling; had, in fact, been expecting this call for weeks now.</p> <p>&#x201c;Look, Dad, I know I&#x2019;m kinda late with my payment&#x2026;&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;I haven&#x2019;t had a phone call, much less a check from you, in three months now,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s going on down there?&#x201d;</p> <p>She swallowed hard. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re just coming into my busiest season. Remember, I told you that? I&#x2019;ve got a spring and summer full of weddings booked. But I&#x2019;ve had all kinds of expenses. Buying the van, getting my website designed, finishing out the shop and buying equipment&#x2026;&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Our agreement was that you&#x2019;d start making payments on the loan in February. You should have had plenty of money from Valentine&#x2019;s Day business, right?&#x201d;</p> <p>She felt a stabbing pain between her eyes. &#x201c;We actually had a pretty good Valentine&#x2019;s Day. But all the profits went back into the shop. My computer died, and I had to buy a new one&#x2026;&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Not my problem,&#x201d; her father shot back. &#x201c;If you&#x2019;d prepared a detailed business plan, as I&#x2019;d suggested, you could have anticipated that a five-year-old computer would need to be replaced. It&#x2019;s called a contingency plan. These things are a cost of doing business, Cara.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;I know, but&#x2026;&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;If you&#x2019;ve got business coming into the shop, I&#x2019;d think you&#x2019;d be in a position to start repaying at least the interest on your loan,&#x201d; he went on.</p> <p>&#x201c;Dad, if you&#x2019;d just let me explain,&#x201d; Cara started.</p> <p>But the Colonel wasn&#x2019;t interested in explanations. Not from her.</p> <p>&#x201c;I should have known something like this would happen. It&#x2019;s never a good idea to loan money to family, especially since you didn&#x2019;t even have a sound business plan for this shop of yours.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s not true,&#x201d; Cara said sharply. &#x201c;I drew up a business plan. I did cost projections, market studies, I researched rent and utilities, I did everything I could. But how could I anticipate something like having to replace a computer? Or a deadbeat innkeeper who refuses to pay me for three months&#x2019; worth of arrangements? Just this morning, I came downstairs, and my flower cooler had died. Along with twelve thousand dollars&#x2019; worth of inventory I need for a wedding tomorrow. Some things are just out of my control, Dad. You of all people know that.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Water under the bridge,&#x201d; he said, interrupting. &#x201c;The fact is, if you can&#x2019;t even begin repaying the interest on a loan, after six months, your business has no hope of success. Even you can see that, right?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;No! I can&#x2019;t see it. My business is building every week. We&#x2019;ve got new clients, a few new commercial accounts. I just need a little more time to get things up and running. This wedding tomorrow, Dad? It&#x2019;s a ten-thousand-dollar deal.&#x201d; Cara hated the pleading note she heard creeping into her voice.</p> <p>&#x201c;For which you just admitted you don&#x2019;t have any flowers,&#x201d; the Colonel shot back. &#x201c;Look, Cara. This just proves my point. You&#x2019;re a smart girl, and a hard worker, I&#x2019;ll give you that. But somebody like you has no business running a business. Take that innkeeper. You think I would have given three months of credit to a new account? Not on your life!&#x201d;</p> <p>Cara felt her left eye twitching, and her headache was taking on a new life of its own. She opened the drawer of her desk, found the bottle of aspirin, popped three into her mouth, and choked them down with a swallow of now-cold coffee.</p> <p>She had to end this call before her head exploded.</p> <p>&#x201c;Dad? I&#x2019;m sorry, but I really need to go now. We&#x2019;ve got to replace those flowers I lost, and I&#x2019;ve got another bride coming in for an appointment. I&#x2019;ll send you a check by the end of next week. Swear to God. And after that, I&#x2019;ll catch up. Monthly payments, just like we agreed. Okay?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;No. Not okay,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I know this is painful for you, Cara, but admit it, this florist thing of yours hasn&#x2019;t worked out. Just like your marriage. And frankly, I&#x2019;m out of patience with pretending everything is okay. I&#x2019;m not some ATM machine, you know. Two years from now, I&#x2019;m retiring from the community college. I have to start thinking about my own welfare. Twenty thousand dollars is a lot of money at my age. I&#x2019;m sorry, but I&#x2019;m pulling the plug on this little enterprise of yours.&#x201d;</p> <p>Cara&#x2019;s eyes widened, and her jaw dropped. &#x201c;Pull the plug? What&#x2019;s that supposed to mean?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Just what it sounds like. It&#x2019;s over, Cara. No more stalling, no more excuses. I&#x2019;m calling your loan. It&#x2019;s still the first week of May. Close up the shop. Call your landlord, let her know you&#x2019;re breaking your lease. Maybe if you give her plenty of advance notice, she&#x2019;ll prorate your rent.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Break the lease?&#x201d; Cara&#x2019;s mouth went dry. Her hands clutched the phone so hard her fingertips turned white. &#x201c;Close the shop?&#x201d;</p> <p>From across the room, Bert, who&#x2019;d given up any pretense of not listening in, looked as shocked as she felt.</p> <p>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s no reason for you to stay down there in Savannah any longer,&#x201d; her father continued, as though everything were settled, just like that, because he said so. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ve no ties, there, really. Leo&#x2019;s not taking you back, and anyway&#x2026;&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Leo?&#x201d; Cara screeched. &#x201c;Dad, I left Leo, not the other way around.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;A technicality,&#x201d; the Colonel said calmly. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s not split hairs. I think it would be better if you got a little place of your own. I could probably talk to somebody here at the school about a job, but if you think you still want to fool around with flowers, you can probably find something around town.&#x2026;&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Dad!&#x201d; Cara shouted into the phone. &#x201c;Stop. Just stop!&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s no need to scream, young lady,&#x201d; the Colonel said sternly. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not deaf.&#x201d;</p> <p><i>You might as well be,</i> Cara thought. <i>You never hear a word I say. You never have. I&#x2019;m thirty-six years old, as you dearly love to point out, and you&#x2019;ve never really listened to me. Not in my whole life.</i></p> <p>&#x201c;I can&#x2019;t discu...</p></p><h2>GMAT Integrated Reasoning and Essay (Manhattan Prep GMAT Strategy Guides)</h2><p>Adapting to the ever-changing GMAT exam, Manhattan Prep&#x2019;s 6th Edition GMAT Strategy Guides offer the latest approaches for students looking to score in the top percentiles.

Addressing one of the most important topics in the yoga field, expert yoga instructor and best-selling author Mark Stephens covers the philosophy of yoga practice, the sensibilities of touch in teaching yoga and improving alignment, the seven principles of hands-on yoga teaching, and the twenty-five most effective methods of tactile cueing. An invaluable resource for all yoga teachers, teacher trainers, and serious yoga students, this book includes a foreword by yoga star Shiva Rea as well as over 850&nbsp;unique instructional photos and explanatory captions demonstrating precise ways of guiding a variety of flowing sequences.<br><br>Opening with an in-depth discussion of the philosophy of yoga assisting, Part I--<i>Foundations</i> describes the methods and techniques of giving yoga assistance, with detailed discussions of all of the elements of yoga assisting including communicating with students, qualities of touch, the five basic steps of providing hands-on cues, hands-on positioning and stance. <br><br>Part II--<i>Applications</i> demonstrates how to assist students in each of over 100 postures in the seven families of <i>asanas</i> (poses). Each chapter begins with background on an asana family and close consideration of its foundation asana. Each asana is presented in a two-page spread with photos that show how to give students effective guidance and support. Part III--<i>Evolution</i> offers thoughts on the further development of yoga in the twenty-first century.</p><p>The author of the best-selling <i>Teaching Yoga: Essential Foundations </i>and<i> Techniques</i> and <i>Yoga Sequencing: Designing Transformative Yoga Classes,</i> MARK STEPHENS has practiced yoga for twenty-two years and has taught yoga full-time for seventeen years. The founder of Yoga Inside Foundation, L.A. Yoga Center, and Santa Cruz Yoga, Stephens has trained over 1,200 yoga teachers. At Yoga Inside Foundation, he trained and supported yoga teachers in over 300 alternative settings across the U.S. and Canada, receiving <i>Yoga Journal</i>'s first Annual Karma Yoga Award in 2000 for this work.Praise for Yoga Adjustments:<br> &nbsp;<br> "<i>Yoga Adjustments</i> shows how to thoughtfully consider adjustments as more than manual manipulation. It's a sensible guide to the best use of verbal cues, hands-on cues, and pose demonstration... Drawing on almost a quarter century of practice, including time spent studying vinyasa, lyengar, and Ashtanga styles, [Stephens] synthesizes hard-earned wisdom within this book." <i>&#x2014;Yoga Journal</i><br> &nbsp;<br> "Mark Stephens has presented us with an invaluable guidebook, not only for the yoga teacher, but for the student as well... <i>Yoga Adjustments</i> is an important addition to everyone's yoga library." <i>&#x2014;Creations Magazine</i><br> &nbsp;<br> "Whether you're in training to be a teacher, just starting your teaching career, or a veteran with many years of experience, Mark Stephens'<i> Yoga Adjustments</i> will prove to be an invaluable resource. As with all his work, this book is written with intelligence, insight, and integrity."<br> &#x2014;Richard Rosen, director of teacher training at Piedmont Yoga and author of <i>Original Yoga<br> &nbsp;</i><br>"I'm very excited about Mark Stephens' new book, which offers an invaluable service to the yoga community&#x2014;teachers, aspiring teachers, and yoga students. As yoga's popularity grows, we need our yoga teachers to mature as well, and Mark has given them a superb guidebook for making smart, safe, clear asana adjustments that further our understanding and deepen our experience of yoga. In this way, the benefits of Mark's expertise extend beyond the yoga community by demonstrating how healthy environments can be created in which anybody can practice yoga with confidence."<br> &#x2014;Cyndi Lee, founder of NYC&#x2019;s Om Yoga and author of <i>May I Be Happy</i> and <i>Yoga Body, Buddha Mind</i><br> &nbsp;<br>"This book is an important contribution to the ongoing evolution of yoga teaching and practice. Hands-on adjustments provide a quick and amazing two-way communication stream between teacher and student. Used with or without verbal cues, they can bypass most abstract theory and induce good alignment to reveal how a pose might feel when balanced, open, flowing, and free. Conversely, adjustments can be mechanical and even manipulative, seductive, and harmful. Because of this powerful potential in both ways, we all need to look intelligently at their mechanics, purposes, and ethics. Stephens' <i>Yoga Adjustments</i> is a wonderfully detailed resource for our investigation."<br> &#x2014;Richard Freeman, director of The Yoga Workshop and author of <i>The Mirror of Yoga<br> &nbsp;</i><br> "As someone who is regularly called upon to treat yoga students injured by ill-informed teachers, I can confidently say that Mark Stephens has done our community a wonderful service with his newest work, <i>Yoga Adjustments</i>. Along with<i> Teaching Yoga </i>and <i>Yoga Sequencing</i>, this book forms a trilogy of essential works for every yoga teacher who strives to be more sensitive, safe, and effective in their teaching."<br> &#x2014;Leslie Kaminoff, founder of The Breathing Project, NYC, and coauthor of <i>Yoga Anatomy</i><br> &nbsp;<br> "Another monumental and much-needed work to guide yoga teachers in making safe and effective hands-on adjustments with their students. Once again Mark Stephens raises the bar and accelerates the evolutionary path of modern yoga. This book is an invaluable reference for today's and future teachers."<br> &#x2014;Ganga White, founder and codirector of White Lotus Foundation and author of <i>Yoga Beyond Belief</i><br> &nbsp;<br> "Just as a good massage feels great and is healing, and a bad massage can be annoying, even painful and unpleasant, so it goes with hands-on assists in yoga. May this book encourage healing touch! Thank you, Mark, for making this information so accessible and clear!"<br> &#x2014;Erich Schiffmann, founder of Freedom Style Yoga and author of <i>Yoga: The Spirit and Practice of Moving Into Stillness</i><br> &nbsp;<br> "I love that Mark Stephens has covered not just the biomechanics of hands-on assists and the spectrum from technical support to subtle energetic direction, but also the internal dynamics and ethics that the power of touch brings up in people of all walks of life. Mark offers practical insights, including the many dimensions of respecting a person's process, injuries, and tweaks, and the important boundaries that are necessary for entering this territory that is often like being a 'midwife of the embodied experience.' Mark brings understanding to the somatic power of touch and the role of hands-on assists in the unfolding of yoga. This is a book that will surely be serving teachers for a long time."<br> &#x2014;Shiva Rea, founder of Prana Flow�&#x2013;Energetic Vinyasa and author of <i>Tending the Heart Fire</i><br> &nbsp;<br> "We generally think of touch as from one person to another. In this book, Stephens reminds us that we must first be 'in touch' with ourselves and with our own yoga practice before adjusting another person's pose. Overall, the book focuses on practical application of adjustments, based on fundamental elements of an ethical personal practice. On asanas, Stephens states that the teacher should understand 'their benefits, risks, contraindications, preparatory asanas, alignment principals, energetic actions, common challenges, modifications, use of props.' Quite thorough, the step-by-step examples are threaded throughout with groundwork in both Western and yoga philosophy. It is a pleasure to read." &nbsp;<br> &#x2014;Lisa Walford, curriculum director of Yoga Works Teacher Training and senior certified Iyengar Yoga teacher<br> &nbsp;<br> "Finally, the book I have been waiting for&#x2014;a clear and thorough guide to hands-on assisting in yoga. Mark Stephens takes us from the guiding principles of touch, observation of students, and establishing intention for touching, through to specific verbal cues and hands-on instruction to support those cues. For teachers, he offers stances to safely ground ourselves while adjusting a student along with terminology for clarifying the various ways of touching for maximum effectiveness. Additionally, Mark provides clear guidance on how not to touch. All of this culminates in a comprehensive index of poses with verbal cues and clear photographs explaining the various options for hands-on assistance to provide greater alignment in the asanas. Never before have we teachers and students had such a concise guide available to us."<br> &#x2014;Marion (Mugs) McConnell, founder of South Okanagan Yoga Academy, British Columbia <br>&nbsp;<br>"A must-read for any yoga teacher looking to expand and deepen not only their knowledge of adjustments, but also of teaching asana as well. The level of detail and knowledge presented here is phenomenal."<br> &#x2014;Chris Courtney, yoga teacher and editor-at-large of <i>Elephant Journal </i><br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br></p><h2>A Charlotte Mason Education: A Home Schooling How-To Manual</h2><p>The immensely popular ideas of Charlotte Mason have inspired educators for many decades.

Listen to what David Bevington has to say in his preface to this sixth edition: <br> <br>&#x201c;No period in history has seen such an extensive study of Shakespeare, and no period has experienced so many revolutions in critical method: feminist, new historical, deconstructive, post-colonial, and more. My attempt has been [constantly] to reeducate myself, to learn more about the complexities of meaning and the innumerable alternative possibilities that present themselves to the student of Shakespeare. Above all, I have tried to learn how to improve accessibility and clarity for today&#x2019;s reader in the interpretation of this extraordinary body of dramatic literature.<br> My hope is that the sixth edition offers students and general readers the most accessible and usable Shakespeare anthology on the market.&#x201d;</p> <br> <p>Surely one of today&#x2019;s premier Shakespeare scholars, David Bevington is also an extraordinary teacher whose concern is always how to make these remarkable plays compelling for every reader. Bevington&#x2019;s work addresses the primary problems most of us have with reading Shakespeare&#x2013;an unfamiliarity both with the historical period and with the challenging language&#x2013;by providing a comprehensive General Introduction that offers wide-ranging historical, cultural, and critical context for our reading, as well as clear, accessible, line-by-line glosses for the sometimes bewildering Elizabethan language and idioms. At a time when many of us come to Shakespeare by way of film, Bevington brings us back to the wonder of the words. </p> <p>Also available: VangoNotes: How to Study Shakespeare offers a new way to hear and experience Shakespeare&#x2019;s language through downloadable podcasts.</p> <p> Visit us at www.pearsonhighered.com</p></p><h2>Power and Love: A Theory and Practice of Social Change</h2><p>The two methods most frequently employed to solve our toughest social problems&#x2014;either relying on violence and aggression or submitting to endless negotiation and compromise&#x2014;are fundamentally flawed. This is because the seemingly contradictory drives behind these approaches&#x2014;<i>power</i>, the desire to achieve one&#x2019;s purpose, and <i>love</i>, the urge to unite with others&#x2014;are actually complementary. As Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. put it, &#x201c;Power without love is reckless and abusive, and love without power is sentimental and anemic.&#x201d; But how do you combine them?<br><br> For the last twenty years Adam Kahane of Reos Partners and the University of Oxford has worked around the world on many tough and vital challenges: food security, health care, economic development, judicial reform, peacemaking, climate change. In this extraordinary book he draws on this experience to delve deeply into the dual natures of both power and love, exploring their subtle and intricate interplay. With disarming honesty Kahane relates how, through trial and error, he has learned to balance them and offers practical guidance for how others can learn that balance as well.</p><p><b>Praise for <i>Power and Love</i></b> <p> "Adam's <i>Solving Tough Problems</i> helped me understand that all of our pressing problems--be they strategic issues inside a company or societal challenges like conflict, poverty, or climate change--require that those with a stake and the power to act come together in open dialogue to create a joint diagnosis and a deep commitment to moving forward together.

John Steinbeck gathered the country's recent shames and devastations--the Hoovervilles, the desperate, dirty children, the dissolution of kin, the oppressive labor conditions--in the Joad family. Then he set them down on a westward-running road, local dialect and all, for the world to acknowledge. For this marvel of observation and perception, he won the Pulitzer in 1940.<p> The prize must have come, at least in part, because alongside the poverty and dispossession, Steinbeck chronicled the Joads' refusal, even inability, to let go of their faltering but unmistakable hold on human dignity. Witnessing their degeneration from Oklahoma farmers to a diminished band of migrant workers is nothing short of crushing. The Joads lose family members to death and cowardice as they go, and are challenged by everything from weather to the authorities to the California locals themselves. As Tom Joad puts it: "They're a-workin' away at our spirits. They're a tryin' to make us cringe an' crawl like a whipped bitch. They tryin' to break us. Why, Jesus Christ, Ma, they comes a time when the on'y way a fella can keep his decency is by takin' a sock at a cop. They're workin' on our decency."</p><p> The point, though, is that decency remains intact, if somewhat battle-scarred, and this, as much as the depression and the plight of the "Okies," is a part of American history. When the California of their dreams proves to be less than edenic, Ma tells Tom: "You got to have patience. Why, Tom--us people will go on livin' when all them people is gone. Why, Tom, we're the people that live. They ain't gonna wipe us out. Why, we're the people--we go on." It's almost as if she's talking about the very novel she inhabits, for Steinbeck's characters, more than most literary creations, do go on. They continue, now as much as ever, to illuminate and humanize an era for generations of readers who, thankfully, have no experiential point of reference for understanding the depression. The book's final, haunting image of Rose of Sharon--Rosasharn, as they call her--the eldest Joad daughter, forcing the milk intended for her stillborn baby onto a starving stranger, is a lesson on the grandest scale. "'You got to,'" she says, simply. And so do we all. <i>--Melanie Rehak</i></p>A heart-wrenching full-cast adaptation of the Pulitzer Prize-winning novel by John Steinbeck, starring Jeffrey Donovan and Shirley Knight. Set during the Great Depression, The Grapes of Wrath tells the powerful story of the Joad family's trek from the dust bowl of Oklahoma to the promise of a new life in California. But what they find threatens to rip apart their lives, and sever the ties that bind them together.

Bowen Series, 82)</h2><p><p>As the commercialization of American higher education accelerates, more and more students are coming to college with the narrow aim of obtaining a preprofessional credential. The traditional four-year college experience&#x2015;an exploratory time for students to discover their passions and test ideas and values with the help of teachers and peers&#x2015;is in danger of becoming a thing of the past.</p><p>In <i>College</i>, prominent cultural critic Andrew Delbanco offers a trenchant defense of such an education, and warns that it is becoming a privilege reserved for the relatively rich. In describing what a true college education should be, he demonstrates why making it available to as many young people as possible remains central to America's democratic promise.</p><p>In a brisk and vivid historical narrative, Delbanco explains how the idea of college arose in the colonial period from the Puritan idea of the gathered church, how it struggled to survive in the nineteenth century in the shadow of the new research universities, and how, in the twentieth century, it slowly opened its doors to women, minorities, and students from low-income families. He describes the unique strengths of America&#x2019;s colleges in our era of globalization and, while recognizing the growing centrality of science, technology, and vocational subjects in the curriculum, he mounts a vigorous defense of a broadly humanistic education for all. Acknowledging the serious financial, intellectual, and ethical challenges that all colleges face today, Delbanco considers what is at stake in the urgent effort to protect these venerable institutions for future generations.</p><p>In a new afterword, Delbanco responds to recent developments&#x2015;both ominous and promising&#x2015;in the changing landscape of higher education.</p></p><p><p>COURSE USE ENDORSEMENT: "We were the first to use <i>College</i> in a first year writing program. The book has been widely successful and served as a wonderful platform for classroom discussions about why students are in school, what do they want to learn, and who they think they want to become. Great praise to Andy Delbanco for writing such a compact book containing both history and wisdom."<b>--Eli C. Goldblatt, Director of First-Year Writing and a professor of English at Temple University</b></p><p>COURSE USE ENDORSEMENT: "Andrew Delbanco's <i>College</i> offers first year undergraduates multiple perspectives onto an experience that each one of them is encountering for the very first time. It is a sophisticated but accessible text that speaks in multiple registers, challenging faculty, professional staff, graduate students, and undergraduates of all ages to think about the past, present, and future of the institution in which they work and live. As a common reading, <i>College</i> provides a framework for the question that every freshman in some way is asking throughout the year--what should college be? That very big question is at the center of a book that asks undergraduates to confront the ethical dilemmas posed by the increasing costs of a higher education that ever fewer people can afford. It also challenges students who will be our future leaders to consider what such inequality might portend for an American democracy whose vitality requires an educated majority citizenry."<b>--Frank Wcislo, Dean of The Ingram Commons, Associate Professor of History and European Studies, Vanderbilt University</b></p><p>COURSE USE ENDORSEMENT: "I have been using the book in a freshman seminar in which we are exploring college. Most of the texts we are using are academic satire novels, but we are using Delbanco's book to help us talk about the place of college in American culture. Although some of the students are not as interested in the historical background, they do find his discussion of the current state of college to be interesting and informative. For example, nearly all of my students are on some form of financial aid, and when they read Delbanco's examination of the costs of college, they seem to wake up intellectually. For them, Delbanco's critique speaks directly to their own experiences and frustrations, and they appreciate learning the contexts. More to the point, they deeply appreciate seeing their anxieties about the costs of college are taken seriously enough to warrant such careful attention by Delbanco. My students also found Delbanco's analysis of teaching and learning methods interesting and informative. They have their own opinions about what creates a good classroom experience, but they had never before seen someone examine different classroom methods in a systematic fashion. Delbanco's discussion of "lateral learning" seemed to provoke the most interesting discussion, and we spent almost an entire class session talking about why that might work in some classes but not others and why they liked and disliked that method of classroom management. Delbanco also spoke at one of our campus colloquia, where he was well received. In the question and answer after his talk, one of my students asked a question, and he was impressed by how seriously Delbanco took his question and how carefully he answered. Delbanco's serious response highlights what my students most appreciated in his book. He takes the entire concept of education seriously and demonstrates a deep understanding of not just the state of the university as it applies to faculty and administrators but also the way it affects the largest--and most important--constituency: the students. It was a revelation to my students that someone in Delbanco's position would take the trouble to think about what it means to be a student."<b>--Richard M. Magee, Ph.D., Associate Professor of English, Director of the Thomas More Honors Living and Learning Community, Sacred Heart University</b></p><p>"Those who love traditional colleges and universities, but also recognize the imperative of reducing inequalities in income and opportunity, confront a profound moral and intellectual challenge. Andrew Delbanco, one of our most humane and rigorous scholars, has turned his energies to this conundrum in his elegant and eloquent book. He writes that 'it is an offense against democracy to presume that education should be reserved for the wellborn and the well-off.' That is where all of our debates must start."<b>--E. J. Dionne Jr., author of <i>Our Divided Political Heart</i></b></p><p>"The special quality of this book stems from its firm grounding in the history of higher education. The result is a work that leads us to look with suspicion on claims that our colleges are deteriorating, challenges us to think anew about other trends that are often viewed as progress, and reminds us of the subtler aims achieved by teaching at its best."<b>--Derek Bok, former president of Harvard University</b></p><p>"An intelligent, nonbombastic look at the state of higher education, <i>College </i>is a hugely useful primer for present and future faculty members, and their students. It should be read by every provost and dean, and by anyone responsible for maintaining a flourishing democracy. Delbanco's pen is neither dipped in the nostalgia for the golden days that never were, nor brushed with the cynicism that embitters those who have accepted the culture of universal commodification. This is a lively, engaging, and important book."<b>--Mary P. McPherson, president emeritus of Bryn Mawr College and executive officer of the American Philosophical Society</b></p><p>"As a defense of liberal education, the humanities, and elite residential colleges, this book offers a more balanced and articulate argument than recent works on higher education and the professoriate. An easy read that is clear, varied, literate, and interesting, this book makes the reader think."<b>--James Axtell, College of William &amp; Mary</b></p><p>"This terrific book is wonderfully direct and engaging, and full of well-chosen historical examples and relevant quotations. Delbanco's love of learning comes through clearly. He eloquently articulates and defends a certain ideal conception of the undergraduate experience and rightly makes us worry about the prospects for preserving it."<b>--Michael McPherson, The Spencer Foundation</b></p><b>Andrew Delbanco</b> is the Mendelson Family Chair of American Studies and the Julian Clarence Levi Professor in the Humanities at Columbia University. His books include <i>Melville: His World and Work</i> (Vintage), which won the Lionel Trilling Award and was a finalist for the <i>Los Angeles Times</i> Book Prize in biography.

Using Sawyer's techniques, new ideas come every day, leading you always further down the zig-zag path to greater creativity. Try these simple techniques, one for each of Sawyer's eight steps.</p> <strong>Find the right question</strong> <p>If you're stumped, it's often because you're asking the wrong question. Maybe your question is too narrow and focused, and you just need to think bigger. For example, instead of asking yourself "Should I repair my old car, or buy a new one?" try asking "Can I get a job within walking distance of home?" or "Can I move closer to public transportation?"</p> <strong>Prepare your mind</strong> <p>The most creative people are voracious learners; they dabble in things they know nothing about. Teach yourself something about weaponry, hypnosis, glass blowing, auto repair, Sufi mysticism...</p> <strong>Be aware</strong> <p>Research shows that the most creative people are more likely talk to lots of different people. So try this: Before you attend your next party or social event, choose a color. Then at the event, make a point of meeting and chatting with anyone who's wearing that color. </p> <strong>Free your mind</strong> <p>When you're facing a creative challenge, try to imagine it as a problem in a very different world, like Dentistry; Lawn care; Furniture design; Prison; The Circus. How would your problem look in that world? How would you try to solve it?</p> <strong>Generate ideas</strong> <p>You can increase your ability to generate good ideas by practicing idea generation every day in simple tasks. For example, make a long list of specific facts about how the world would be different: If gravity stopped for one second each day? If there were five sexes? Come up with your own idea challenges as you go through your day. In the kitchen: What if my refrigerator had 20 shelves? <em>Preparing for bed at night:</em> What if people could sleep standing up?</p> <strong>Combine ideas</strong> <p>The best insights come from combining ideas that are completely unrelated. Take out paper and pencil and sketch a piece of furniture that is also a kind of fruit; or, a lampshade that is also a kind of book; or, just pick two words at random by closing your eyes and pointing at different pages in a book, and invent a combination.</p> <strong>Make ideas even better</strong> <p>Once you have a few ideas, take each one of them (even the ones that aren't so great) and list at least three benefits of that idea, and then list at least three practical steps you would have to take to implement the idea. This simple technique often helps you think of ways to make the ideas even better.</p> <strong>Get your ideas into the world</strong> <p>Buy a stack of ten magazines. (Or take some of those old magazines in your dentist's waiting room) Clip out any photos that seem related to your problem, and keep going until you have 50 photos. Use a glue stick and make a collage by sticking them onto a large piece of poster board. Keep the collage near your desk for a couple of weeks, and make sure to look at it each day.</p><p>"No matter what kind of creativity I studied, the process was the same. Creativity did not descend like a bolt of lightning that lit up the world in a single brilliant flash. It came in tiny steps, bits of insight, and incremental changes. Zigs and zags. When people followed those zigs and zags, ideas and revelations started flowing."<br> <b>--From the Introduction</b></p> <p>Can you be more creative? Absolutely, and <i>Zig Zag</i> shows you how.

Forensic scientists can unlock the mysteries of the past and help serve justice using the messages left by a corpse, a crime scene, or the faintest of human traces. Now available in paperback, <i>Forensics</i> goes behind the scenes with some of these top-level professionals and their groundbreaking research, drawing on original interviews and firsthand experience on scene with top forensic scientists. Along the way, we discover how maggots collected from a corpse can help determine time of death; how a DNA trace a millionth the size of a grain of salt can be used to convict a killer; and how a team of young Argentine scientists led by a maverick American anthropologist were able to uncover the victims of a genocide. The journey takes us to war zones, fire scenes, and autopsy suites, reveals both extraordinary bravery and true wickedness, as we trace the history of forensics from its earliest beginnings to the cutting-edge science of the modern day.</p><p>A former journalist and Northern Bureau Chief of a national UK tabloid, <b>Val McDermid</b> is the best-selling author of thirty novels, three story collections, and another non-fiction book called <i>A Suitable Job for a Woman</i>, an inside look at female private investigators.

But many low-income neighborhoods and communities of color have been systematically deprived of access to healthy and sustainable food. These communities have been actively prevented from producing their own food and often live in &#x201c;food deserts&#x201d; where fast food is more common than fresh food. <i>Cultivating Food Justice</i> describes their efforts to envision and create environmentally sustainable and socially just alternatives to the food system. </p><p>Bringing together insights from studies of environmental justice, sustainable agriculture, critical race theory, and food studies,<i> Cultivating Food Justice </i>highlights the ways race and class inequalities permeate the food system, from production to distribution to consumption. The studies offered in the book explore a range of important issues, including agricultural and land use policies that systematically disadvantage Native American, African American, Latino/a, and Asian American farmers and farmworkers; access problems in both urban and rural areas; efforts to create sustainable local food systems in low-income communities of color; and future directions for the food justice movement. These diverse accounts of the relationships among food, environmentalism, justice, race, and identity will help guide efforts to achieve a just and sustainable agriculture.</p></p><p>Alison Hope Alkon is Assistant Professor in the Department of Sociology at the University of the Pacific.<p>The diversity of theoretical and conceptual approaches, subjects, and authors is refreshing.

In doing so, it provides an oblique self-portrait of the young Joyce himself. At its center lie questions of origin and source, authority and authorship, and the relationship of an artist to his family, culture, and race. Exuberantly inventive in style, the novel subtly and beautifully orchestrates the patterns of quotation and repetition instrumental in its hero&#x2019;s quest to create his own character, his own language, life, and art: &#x201c;to forge in the smithy of my soul the uncreated conscience of my race.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> This Penguin Classics Deluxe Edition, published for the novel&#x2019;s centennial, is the definitive text, authorized by the Joyce estate and collated from all known proofs, manuscripts, and impressions to reflect the author&#x2019;s original wishes.<br> &nbsp;<br> For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world.

Through a series of brilliant epiphanies that parallel the development of his own aesthetic consciousness, Joyce evokes Stephen&#39;s youth, from his impressionable years as the youngest student at the Clongowed Wood school to the deep religious conflict he experiences at a day school in Dublin, and finally to his college studies where he challenges the conventions of his upbringing and his understanding of faith and intellectual freedom. James Joyce&#39;s highly autobiographical novel was first published in the United States in 1916 to immediate acclaim. Ezra Pound accurately predicted that Joyce&#39;s book would &#34;remain a permanent part of English literature,&#34; while H.G. Wells dubbed it &#34;by far the most important living and convincing picture that exists of an Irish Catholic upbringing.&#34; A remarkably rich study of a developing young mind, &#34;A Portrait Of The Artist As A Young Man made an indelible mark on literature and confirmed Joyce&#39;s reputation as one of the world&#39;s greatest and lasting writers.</p><h2>Fastest Things on Wings: Rescuing Hummingbirds in Hollywood</h2><p><b>A heartwarming account of the trials and triumphs a hummingbird rehabber encounters while caring for her tiny, fragile patients</b><br><br> Before he collided with a limousine, Gabriel, an Anna&#x2019;s hummingbird with a head and throat cloaked in iridescent magenta feathers, could spiral 130 feet in the air, dive 60 miles per hour in a courtship display, hover, and fly backward.

Lee, former legal editor of the <em>Chicago Tribune</em>, cross-examines a dozen experts with doctorates who are specialists in the areas of old manuscripts, textual criticism, and biblical studies. Strobel challenges the experts with questions such as, <em>How reliable is the New Testament? Does evidence for Jesus exist outside the Bible?

Complimented with an exclusive interview with Strobel, this timeless book is one any graduate will want to keep and re-read for years to come.</p></p><p><i>The Case for Christ</i> records Lee Strobel's attempt to "determine if there's credible evidence that Jesus of Nazareth really is the Son of God." The book consists primarily of interviews between Strobel (a former legal editor at the <i>Chicago Tribune</i>) and biblical scholars such as Bruce Metzger. Each interview is based on a simple question, concerning historical evidence (for example, "Can the Biographies of Jesus Be Trusted?"), scientific evidence, ("Does Archaeology Confirm or Contradict Jesus' Biographies?"), and "psychiatric evidence" ("Was Jesus Crazy When He Claimed to Be the Son of God?"). Together, these interviews compose a case brief defending Jesus' divinity, and urging readers to reach a verdict of their own.A Seasoned Journalist Chases Down the Leads in the Biggest News Story in History</p><h2>The story of the world: Ancient times, from the earliest Nomads to the last Roman emperor history for the classical child, Vol. 1</h2><p><p><strong>History will never be the same again!</strong></p> This spirited reading of the first in Susan Wise Bauer's <em>Story of the World</em> history series brings to life the stories and records of the peoples of ancient times.<br><br> Now more than ever, other countries and customs affect our everyday lives-and our children need to learn about the people who live all around the globe.

In the three decades since then, Jim's narration voice and seemingly numberless character voices have formed foundational entertainment and education for millions of listeners around the world.<br> Winning hundreds of awards, Jim&#x2019;s recordings range on the literary side from fairy tales through stories from Shakespeare, Dickens and Conan Doyle, while his history recordings bring to vivid life major historical events and personalities from the ancient world through the twentieth century.<br> The inspiration for all this began early, with parents and grandparents who told stories and read aloud to him, skills which Jim joyously acquired, and which led him to a degree in Communications and Speech from the University of Wisconsin, Madison. Later, his wife, Randy, earned her own national awards as a teacher and counselor, and their shared passion for learning led to forming their company in 1989, long before the explosion of spoken word recordings made this a "sensible" decision. The recordings began winning listeners and national awards from the first. A few years ago, the Weiss's licensed their recordings and business operations to Well-Trained Mind Press, which has successfully introduced Jim's work into still more markets, while Jim continues to write, record, teach and perform. <strong><br></strong></p>&#x201c;This may well be the best multi-age read aloud narrative of world history yet to have been written.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Homeschooling in Japan</em></strong></p><h2>The Conscious Mind: In Search of a Fundamental Theory (Philosophy of Mind)</h2><p>What is consciousness? How do physical processes in the brain give rise to the self-aware mind and to feelings as profoundly varied as love or hate, aesthetic pleasure or spiritual yearning? These questions today are among the most hotly debated issues among scientists and philosophers, and we have seen in recent years superb volumes by such eminent figures as Francis Crick, Daniel C. Dennett, Gerald Edelman, and Roger Penrose, all firing volleys in what has come to be called the consciousness wars. Now, in <em>The Conscious Mind</em>, philosopher David J. Chalmers offers a cogent analysis of this heated debate as he unveils a major new theory of consciousness, one that rejects the prevailing reductionist trend of science, while offering provocative insights into the relationship between mind and brain.<br> Writing in a rigorous, thought-provoking style, the author takes us on a far-reaching tour through the philosophical ramifications of consciousness. Chalmers convincingly reveals how contemporary cognitive science and neurobiology have failed to explain how and why mental events emerge from physiological occurrences in the brain. He proposes instead that conscious experience must be understood in an entirely new light--as an irreducible entity (similar to such physical properties as time, mass, and space) that exists at a fundamental level and cannot be understood as the sum of its parts. And after suggesting some intriguing possibilities about the structure and laws of conscious experience, he details how his unique reinterpretation of the mind could be the focus of a new science. Throughout the book, Chalmers provides fascinating thought experiments that trenchantly illustrate his ideas. For example, in exploring the notion that consciousness could be experienced by machines as well as humans, Chalmers asks us to imagine a thinking brain in which neurons are slowly replaced by silicon chips that precisely duplicate their functions--as the neurons are replaced, will consciousness gradually fade away? The book also features thoughtful discussions of how the author's theories might be practically applied to subjects as diverse as artificial intelligence and the interpretation of quantum mechanics.<br> All of us have pondered the nature and meaning of consciousness. Engaging and penetrating, <em>The Conscious Mind</em> adds a fresh new perspective to the subject that is sure to spark debate about our understanding of the mind for years to come.<br></p><p><br><em>About the Author:</em><br> <strong>David J. Chalmers</strong> is a professor of philosophy at the University of California, Santa Cruz. Born in Sydney, Australia, he has been a Rhodes Scholar at the University of Oxford and a McDonnell Fellow at Washington University. His article "The Puzzle of Conscious Experience" appeared in the December 1995 issue of <em>Scientific American</em>.<br>"Offers an outstandingly competent survey of the field and because its author, a mathematician versed in computer science, rejects materialism of all kinds in favor of a surprisingly old-fashioned dualism."--The Economist<br><br>"Chalmers shakes up the reductionist world of neurological research by asserting that scientists need to approach the conscious experience as a basic, nonphysical component of the world, similar to time, space, and matter."--Science News<br><br>"David Chalmers is widely credited for posing the so-called hard problem of consciousness:...What is the nature of subjective experience? Why do we have vividly felt experiences of the world? Why is there someone home inside our heads?"--The New York Times<br><br>"Certainly one of the best discussions of consciousness in existence. Chalmers has done about as good a job as could be done on this most intractable of problems." --Colin McGinn, The Times Higher Education Supplement<br><br>"Taking as his starting point some very intuitive notions about consciousness, David Chalmers arrives at strange and startling conclusions about what this central knot of human existence really is. This is a grand exploration of the topic, brilliantly argued by someone who knows the territory<br>inside out. Though I personally can't go everywhere Chalmers wants to take me, he's certainly one of the best possible guides."--Douglas Hofstadter, Indiana University<br><br>"This splendid book is essential reading for anyone interested in the place of consciousness in the natural world. Chalmers argues persuasively and eloquently that standard reductive approaches in cognitive science and in philosophy of mind inevitably address only the easier problems<br>associated with consciousness while ignoring the hard and central problem of explaining the phenomenal ("what it's like") qualities of experience--and that there is no hope of explaining these features reductively.... The book is lucidly and engagingly written and is accessible to a wide audience of<br>readers."--Terence E. Horgan, The University of Memphis<br><br>"Consciousness is the challenge to the physicalist orthodoxy in current cognitive science and philosophy of mind. This book is a brilliant presentation of that challenge. In addition, it is a major essay in the philosophy of mind that has much to teach us whatever our allegiances."--Frank<br>Jackson, Australian National University<br><br>"In my view, The Conscious Mind will likely be considered the best of the many books that have appeared on the topic of consciousness in the past several years. Unlike many recent writers, Chalmers does not evade the problem of consciousness by redefining the problem away; he faces the problem<br>squarely and is prepared to take the consequences. The book is written with admirable and refreshing clarity, and brims with enthusiasm and a sense of excitement."--Jaegwon Kim, Brown University<br><br>"In theorizing about the 'hard' problem of consciousness, Chalmers adopts the most sensible approach among contemporary philosophers. Unlike most of his colleagues, he embraces the phenomenal reality of consciousness as given and attempts to explain it within a scientific framework. His book<br>goes a long way towards establishing the seemingly obvious: consciousness is a real phenomenon of the natural world that cries out for a rational, naturalistic explanation."--Christof Koch, California Institute of Technology<br><br>"The most comprehensive book to date on consciousness. It presents an exciting new theory that expands our conception of the natural world without being reductive or non-naturalistic."--Owen Flanagan, Duke University</p><h2>Old Testament Today, 2nd Edition: A Journey from Ancient Context to Contemporary Relevance</h2><p><p>This proven Old Testament text with a wealth of full-color images helps readers connect the world of the Old Testament with today's world. <em>Old Testament Today, 2nd Edition</em>, newly revised, includes a book-by-book survey, new maps and graphics, and other updates throughout.</p><p>Unique among Old Testament surveys, <em>Old Testament Today, 2nd Edition</em> not only provides an orientation to the world of the Old Testament, but also builds a bridge between the original audience and modern readers, demonstrating why the ancient message is important for faith and life today.

It is the tale of Rosen's journey as well, carrying the torch for the game of basketball through careers as star college player, CBA coach, and preeminent novelist of the game. It is also the story of the system jackson coaches, the powertriangle, as put forth by Lakers assistant coach Tex Winter. The triangle can be understood as a philosophy of basketball and life&#x2014;one that values role players almost as much as star players, and where fundamentals rule. More Than a Game is also a story of the friendship between Jackson and Rosen, forged in the sacred brotherhood of the hoop.</p><p>A native of the Bronx and longtime pal of basketball guru Phil Jackson,&nbsp;<b>CHARLEY ROSEN</b>&nbsp;led the league in technical fouls during each of his six years as a coach in the now-defunct Continental Basketball Association.

On the surface, it examines the 1999-2000 season of the L.A. Lakers--"the Shaq and Kobe Show." Actually, it is about the journeys of two men through the several worlds of basketball: high school, small college, minor league professional, and the NBA. One author reads a section, then passes the mike to his co-author. Each talks largely about his own career, but the careers intersect on several occasions. Both have pleasant speaking voices.

The Snakehead is a panoramic tale of international intrigue and a dramatic portrait of the underground economy in which America&#39;s twelve million illegal immigrants live.</p><p><b>Book Description</b><br> A mesmerizing narrative about the rise and fall of an unlikely international crime boss.<br> <p>In the 1980s, a wave of Chinese from Fujian province began arriving in America. Like other immigrant groups before them, they showed up with little money but with an intense work ethic and an unshakeable belief in the promise of the United States. Many of them lived in a world outside the law, working in a shadow economy overseen by the ruthless gangs that ruled the narrow streets of New York&#x2019;s Chinatown.</p> <p>The figure who came to dominate this Chinese underworld was a middle-aged grandmother known as Sister Ping. Her path to the American dream began with an unusual business run out of a tiny noodle store on Hester Street. From her perch above the shop, Sister Ping ran a full-service underground bank for illegal Chinese immigrants. But her real business&#x2014;a business that earned an estimated $40 million&#x2014;was smuggling people.</p> <p>As a &#x201c;snakehead,&#x201d; she built a complex&#x2014;and often vicious&#x2014;global conglomerate, relying heavily on familial ties, and employing one of Chinatown's most violent gangs to protect her power and profits. Like an underworld CEO, Sister Ping created an intricate smuggling network that stretched from Fujian Province to Hong Kong to Burma to Thailand to Kenya to Guatemala to Mexico. Her ingenuity and drive were awe-inspiring both to the Chinatown community&#x2014;where she was revered as a homegrown Don Corleone&#x2014;and to the law enforcement officials who could never quite catch her.</p> <p>Indeed, Sister Ping&#x2019;s empire only came to light in 1993 when the Golden Venture, a ship loaded with 300 undocumented immigrants, ran aground off a Queens beach. It took New York&#x2019;s fabled &#x201c;Jade Squad&#x201d; and the FBI nearly ten years to untangle the criminal network and hone in on its unusual mastermind.</p> <p><i>The Snakehead</i> is a panoramic tale of international intrigue and a dramatic portrait of the underground economy in which America&#x2019;s twelve million illegal immigrants live. Based on hundreds of interviews, Patrick Radden Keefe&#x2019;s sweeping narrative tells the story not only of Sister Ping, but of the gangland gunslingers who worked for her, the immigration and law enforcement officials who pursued her, and the generation of penniless immigrants who risked death and braved a 17,000 mile odyssey so that they could realize their own version of the American dream. <i>The Snakehead</i> offers an intimate tour of life on the mean streets of Chinatown, a vivid blueprint of organized crime in an age of globalization and a masterful exploration of the ways in which illegal immigration affects us all.</p> <strong>A Q&amp;A with Patrick Radden Keefe</strong><br><br> <b>Question:</b> Can you tell us a little bit about Sister Ping? She is one of the most unusual "godmothers" in the annals of modern crime.<br> <p><b>Answer:</b> Sure. I first found out about Sister Ping in 2006, when she was on trial in New York. It emerged that she was a Chinese woman who had come to the United States in 1981 with no education, didn&#x2019;t speak English, and started smuggling other people&#x2014;from her home village and then the region in China that she came from&#x2014;to the U.S. She did this for the better part of two decades, and made $40 million or so in the process, and then went on the lam. She was the FBI&#x2019;s most wanted Asian organized crime figure for another five or six years before they finally tracked her down in Hong Kong, extradited her to the U.S., and tried her.</p> <p><b>Q:</b> If you passed her in the street, or went by her place of work, if you were wandering around Chinatown as a tourist, would you have any idea about what she did?</p> <p><b>A:</b> You wouldn&#x2019;t give her a second look. This was a part of what was so fascinating about her; she made an enormous fortune but she made a point of being very humble in her appearance. She worked incredibly long hours, and there was nothing ostentatious about the way she carried herself. And I actually think that this studied anonymity was part of what allowed her to do what she did with impunity for so long. And it also secured her a huge amount of respect within the Chinatown neighborhood, where she was regarded as kind of a humble, hometown heroine who hadn&#x2019;t let the success she&#x2019;d had go to her head.</p> <p><b>Q:</b> Sister Ping was clever enough to distance herself from the more violent aspects of human trafficking. How did she outsource the seedier aspects of what she was doing, and how did that ultimately affect her?</p> <p><b>A:</b> Well, this in some ways was what brought about her downfall, in that she was always a perfectionist, and when she started out as a smuggler in the early 1980s she would transport people herself. By that I mean, she would be there in Hong Kong when she put them on a plane; they would be flown to Guatemala, she would be there in Guatemala when they arrived. They would be escorted up through Mexico; she would meet them in California, then she would fly back with them to New York City. But as her operation grew, and the word spread&#x2014;really, around the world&#x2014;that this was a woman who could move anyone from point A to point B, it got so large that she could no longer oversee everything herself, and she had to start subcontracting. And this, in some ways, was her great mistake, because she subcontracted to a very violent gang of youths in Chinatown known as the Fuk Ching gang, and the gang, ultimately&#x2014;because they were less scrupulous than she was about issues of safety and things like that&#x2014;ended up mismanaging things. There were a number of these journeys that ended in death, and then a number of murders as well.</p> <p><b>Q:</b> Tell us what the title <i>The Snakehead</i> means.</p> <p><b>A:</b> The snakehead is the name, the Chinese name, to refer to these human smugglers, who basically emerged in China in the 1960s and 1970s, helping smuggle people out of China. But then in the late 1980s and early 1990s&#x2014;basically after Tiananmen Square&#x2014;it became a massive (many say four- to six-billion-dollar-a-year) industry. These were the snakeheads, and among the snakeheads Sister Ping was the most prolific and certainly the most famous. </p> <p>In the case of The Golden Venture, they would bring these ships to the U.S., and they wouldn&#x2019;t want to bring them right to the shore in California or Massachusetts or New York&#x2014;as you can imagine, it would look a little strange to have a freighter coming up, to appear in Brooklyn and drop off hundreds of Chinese people. So they would bring them to about a hundred miles off shore, out in the open ocean, and then they would send out small fishing boats which would offload the ships. This was called offloading and it was actually a kind of niche in the industry. And the gangsters were the ones who occupied this niche. They would take these fishing boats out and bring the passengers back in. Because Sister Ping had outsourced offloading to one of these gangs, the gang happened to have a lot of inner turmoil in the early part of 1993, precisely because they were making so much money in the snakehead business and they didn&#x2019;t know how to divide it, and so there was a massive shoot-out just weeks before The Golden Venture arrived, and the guys who were supposed to go and offload the ship were all killed in the shootout. All of the guys who had gone to kill them were hoping they could be the ones to go and offload it and collect the money from the passengers, but they were all locked up and put in prison. So when the ship arrived, there was nobody to offload it, and that was why it came in&#x2014;all the way in, to the Rockaways, in Queens, and actually ran aground right there on the beach in the media capital of the world.</p> <p><b>Q:</b> Of course, the real payoff for the reader is this reading experience&#x2014;this is an amazing crime story with incredible twists and turns. </p> <p><b>A:</b> Yeah; it&#x2019;s funny, I really didn&#x2019;t anticipate this to be the case when I began the research. As I started digging in and talking to law enforcement sources and finding out about these various underworld figures, in Chinatown but also in places like Bangkok, I began to realize the relationships between them. One of the things that&#x2019;s interesting in the book is that you realize that a whole series of people were actually cooperating with American authorities at different times over the years, that we&#x2019;d never really known about. And in many cases, they were going to American authorities and giving them information about one another. There was an interesting, almost spy-versus-spy game going on between these ruthless, but also very enterprising and business-minded, underworld figures. </p> <p>(Photo � Sai Srikandarajah)</p>PATRICK RADDEN KEEFE is a fellow at The Century Foundation and the author of <i>Chatter</i>.

The novel is based on the true story of a labor and delivery nurse who was prohibited from caring for a newborn because the father requested that no African-American nurses tend to his baby. In the fictional version, Ruth, the African-American nurse in question, finds herself on trial for events related to the same request made by a white supremacist father. Using the narratives of Ruth, the baby&#x2019;s father, and the female public defender who takes Ruth&#x2019;s case, Picoult examines multiple facets of racism. The topic of race in America is difficult to talk about, but in in an honest and revealing way Picoult allows readers to draw their own conclusions about how we see ourselves and others in the world. <em>Small Great Things</em> is an important and thought-provoking novel about power and prejudice that deserves to be read, digested, and shared with others. <em>--Seira Wilson, The Amazon Book Review</em>JODI PICOULT is the author of twenty-three novels, including <i>Leaving Time</i> and the #1 <i>New York Times</i> bestsellers<i> Sing You Home</i>, <i>House Rules</i>, <i>Handle With Care</i>,<i> Change of Heart</i>, <i>Nineteen Minutes</i>, and<i> My Sister's Keeper</i>.

The tools-technology and know-how already are abundantly available. But, profound questions remain. Do law enforcement executives possess sufficient awareness of why they should change? Do they have the will and the fortitude to oppose the status quo? The authors of this book devote considerable attention to the relationship between true community-oriented policing and the analysis of crime. They also address a more mundane, but no less important, practice in desperate need of rejuvenation--the fundamental procedures through which agencies calculate patrol workloads. Determining how many officers should do what, as well as where, when, how, and why they do it, represents the apex of crime analysis. Discussion of these issues makes up the sum and substance of Crime Analysis. In fact, the book&#39;s discussion is so comprehensive that it eliminates many of the excuses that traditionalist police executives have used to defend their failure to innovate. In creating the first practical &#34;how to&#34; guide to crime analysis, the authors render obsolete the rationalization that has allowed departments to cling to the status quo in lieu of embracing real analytical methods. Crime Analysis is a coherent compendium for progressive administrators who would challenge the status quo in order to more effectively address the crime problems that face their communities. This book will serve to enlighten, but through its comprehensive treatment of an often-obscure subject, it may also provide a sound basis for leading law enforcement out of the darkness of the past.</p><p></p><h2>A Rumpole Christmas: Stories</h2><p><b>The first ever collection of Rumpole Christmas stories? just in time for the holidays</b><br><br> A <i>Rumpole Christmas</i> is a collection of five holiday stories?never before published in book form? depicting the Old Bailey Hack at his lovable best. In ?Rumpole and Father Christmas,? the English barrister encounters a familiar-looking Santa who he thinks is a thief. In ?Rumpole?s Slimmed Down Christmas,? he goes to a new-age spa when ?She who must be obeyed? insists that he lose a few pounds. In ?Rumpole and the Christmas Break,? he protects Hilda as a shady judge flirts with her while on a holiday that turns out to be anything but relaxing.<br><br> Witty and compulsively readable, this irresistible new collection will provide solace to the legions of fans lamenting John Mortimer?s death early this year.<br><br></p><p>John Mortimer is a playwright, novelist, and former practicing barrister who has written many film scripts as well as stage, radio, and television plays, the Rumpole plays, for which he received the British Academy Writer of the Year Award, and the adaptation of Evelyn Waugh&#x2019;s <i>Brideshead Revisited</i>. He is the author of twelve collections of Rumpole stories and three acclaimed volumes of autobiography.As listeners would expect, Horace Rumpole spends his holidays in the Old Bailey, defending a terrorism suspect, among others, and seeking truth, including the possibility that two former clients have gone straight. Bill Wallis&#39;s Rumpole sounds a bit wearier than Leo McKern&#39;s definitive version but retains his passion for justice and sense of humor. Wallis also creates the perfect voice for Judge Graves, a frequent Rumpole adversary. Since this is a Christmas volume, Mortimer treats listeners to a couple of lighter stories, including Rumpole&#39;s misadventures with a Christmas party and online shopping. Whether listeners have heard them before or not, the stories have a familiar feel (Rumpole gives She Who Must Be Obeyed lavender water every year). This will prove an enjoyable Christmas treat for fans.

Robert Byrd lives in Haddonfield, New Jersey.Ages 5-9. When Saint Francis, known for his love and respect for animals, meets a donkey in the forest, the donkey rails against the unfair lot of his kind, who are forced to carry heavy burdens and laughed at for the strange sound they make. Francis first tells the animal the lively, funny story of how the donkey came by its bray, and then tells a more consoling tale about the donkey that carried Mary into Bethlehem. Although of little use to children, a two-page opening note provides excellent background on Francis. Byrd's evocative language, however, will attract readers and listeners of many ages. The pace of his story is measured and calm, and the paintings are large and spacious, some glittering with details, others open and peaceful. The beautiful closing double-page spread shows Francis and the donkey standing in the snow and gazing at one particularly bright star in the sky. <i>Susan Dove Lempke</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Sloan)</h2><p><p>"Fans have waited two years for another of Aird's Calleshire County police procedurals, and if you like golf, this well-crafted whodunit was especially worth the wait....Full of poetical, biblical and Shakespearian references, this fun read delivers a denouement that finishes the game well under par. Nicely played."<br>&#x2013;<i>Publishers Weekly</i> on <i>Hole in One</i></p><p>"Trust mystery writer Catherine Aird to add her own special twists and lots of biting wit to murder...the settings are classic, the characters delightfully quirky, and the words of wisdom many." &#x2013;<i>Boston Herald</i> on <i>Amendment of Life</i></p><p>The dramatic theft of an 18th Century painting is discovered just moments before the old manor house from which it was stolen &#x2013; and is uniquely depicted in the background of the portrait -- is set on fire. Making matters more grisly even is the pile of bones that is sighted in the blazing inferno moments before the roof collapses. What started as simple, if surprising, theft has quickly escalated to arson and, possibly murder, and now Detective Inspector Sloan and Detective Constable Crosby have to piece together, a puzzle which has its roots deep in Berebury&#x2019;s history. Although Tolmie Park, the property on which the manor house sits, has had a somewhat checkered and mysterious past there are those in the community who would fight to preserve it. There are also a number of factions within the area who have differing plans to develop the property, shrouding the fire in further suspicion. It is up D.C.I. C.D. Sloan to sift through this assortment of characters and, finally, illuminate the truth.</p></p><p>Catherine Aird is the author of some twenty crime novels and story collections, most of which feature Detective Chief Inspector C.D.

And again. &#x2018;It&#x2019;s in the middle of nowhere, actually.&#x2019;<br>&#x2018;A country house that looks as if it&#x2019;s falling down,&#x2019; pointed out Bellamy.<br>&#x2018;It does, doesn&#x2019;t it?&#x2019; agreed Jason, reaching for a sheet of music. &#x2018;I expect it is, too. It&#x2019;s pretty old.&#x2019;<br>&#x2018;It looks it,&#x2019; said Bellamy, adding studiously, &#x2018;Jason, you&#x2019;ve got a house already. A nice one.&#x2019;<br>&#x2018;Sure,&#x2019; said Jason agreeably, &#x2018;but I want this one, too.&#x2019;<br>Stuart Bellamy said nothing for a moment. Working as the manager of Jason Burke, who was known to the wider world of Pop Music as Kevin Cowlick, had already led him into the wilder areas of finance &#x2013; ones that had not been covered by his own accountancy apprenticeship. Actually, Bellamy hadn&#x2019;t completed his apprenticeship to become a fully qualified accountant &#x2013; not that Jason cared about that &#x2013; but every now and then he wished he had. This was one of those times.<br>Eventually, sounding as if he understood his employer&#x2019;s way of thought, he said, &#x2018;Of course, it&#x2019;s bigger than this one you&#x2019;ve got now.&#x2019; He waved towards the forty-track synthesiser at the other end of the room. &#x2018;And there&#x2019;d be much more room for extra equipment.&#x2019;<br>&#x2018;Oh, it&#x2019;s not that,&#x2019; said Jason casually, his hand straying to the lock of hair that fell across his forehead and was the inspiration for his stage name. &#x2018;It&#x2019;s for sentimental reasons. That&#x2019;s why I want it.&#x2019;<br>&#x2018;Ah...&#x2019; murmured Stuart Bellamy.<br>&#x2018;First big bike ride me and my mate took out of Luston &#x2013; we were only nippers at the time &#x2013; we fetched up at this Tolmie Park and I thought that if I got to be rich and famous that I&#x2019;d like to live there.&#x2019;<br>&#x2018;I see,&#x2019; said Bellamy. And he did. Jason was not the only young man to have spotted a goal early in life and used it as something to aim for or to lay at the feet of some lady. The difference was that Jason was still young...and so far there was no lady.<br>&#x2018;And now I&#x2019;m rich and famous,&#x2019; said Jason simply, &#x2018;I&#x2019;m going to have it.&#x2019; He resumed playing his guitar.<br>&#x2018;That may be easier said than done,&#x2019; pointed out Bellamy cautiously. &#x2018;Whoever owns it may not want to sell.&#x2019;<br>&#x2018;Every man has his price,&#x2019; responded Jason. This was one thing that success and its consequent great wealth had already taught the young pop star.<br>&#x2018;True,&#x2019; said Stuart Bellamy, &#x2018;very true, but don&#x2019;t forget it may cost.&#x2019;<br>Jason Burke let his glance travel meaningfully over a rack of albums all with the name of Kevin Cowlick on them before he said again &#x2018;I want it.&#x2019;<br>&#x2018;Sure,&#x2019; said Bellamy.<br>&#x2018;So go get it for me, Stu &#x2013; oh, and Stu...&#x2019;<br>&#x2018;Yes?&#x2019;<br>&#x2018;Get me another djembe, too.&#x2019;<br>&#x2018;Okey dokey.&#x2019; Stuart Bellamy thought how like Jason it was to want him to buy for him both a vast country estate and a new drum in the same breath. &#x2018;Will do.&#x2019;<br>&#x2018;It&#x2019;s an outrage,&#x2019; spluttered Marcus Fixby-Smith, curator of the Greatorex Museum in Granary Row, Berebury. &#x2018;An absolute outrage.&#x2019;<br>&#x2018;It would appear to be a case of theft,&#x2019; pronounced Detective Inspector CD Sloan, rather less emotionally. He was head of the tiny Criminal Investigation Department of F Division of the Calleshire County Constabulary. As such almost all matters that could not be diverted to Traffic Division or the Family Case Officer landed up on his plate.<br>This was one of them.<br>&#x2018;Robbery with violence,&#x2019; insisted the curator, pointing to the damaged glass top of a showcase.<br>&#x2018;Breaking and entering,&#x2019; countered Sloan briskly, indicating the smashed window of the gallery and broken glass.<br>The museum curator tossed his long hair out of his eyes and said, &#x2018;Inspector, the thief, whoever he was, as well as stealing a portrait, did violence to this show cabinet and quite possibly to the exhibition pieces on display inside it.&#x2019;<br>&#x2018;I can see that that is very likely, sir,&#x2019; agreed Sloan, peering at the damaged piece of museum furniture and its disarranged contents.<br>&#x2018;He must have gone through the glass top while he was standing on it to reach up to get at the portrait,&#x2019; declared Fixby-Smith.<br>&#x2018;You could well be right about that,&#x2019; said Sloan equably. &#x2018;Where would this showcase have been standing in the ordinary way?&#x2019;<br>Marcus Fixby-Smith waved a hand and pointed to the middle of the room. &#x2018;Just over there. Easy enough to drag it up against the wall and hop onto it.&#x2019;<br>The museum curator had at his side his assistant, an intelligent and able young woman wearing glasses, called Hilary Collins. Her low-key sandy-coloured blouse and skirt were in direct contrast to the flamboyant clothes of her boss.<br>Detective Inspector CD Sloan, known to his friends in the Force for obvious reasons as &#x2018;Seedy&#x2019;, had not been quite so fortunate. He had with him at his side at the museum as his assistant Detective Constable Crosby, dressed &#x2013; at least in theory &#x2013; in what was officially described in police circles as plain clothes.<br>Crosby, though admittedly young, was not really up to being at the cutting edge of detection. What Superintendent Leeyes had said when the call from the museum had come through was: &#x2018;Take him with you, Sloan. He can&#x2019;t do any more damage there and he might even learn something.&#x2019;<br>Seeing the constable advancing at the double on the broken glass of the show cabinet now, Sloan wasn&#x2019;t so sure of either the premise or the possibility. &#x2018;The Scenes of Crime Officer will want to examine that first, Crosby,&#x2019; he said swiftly, motioning him back.<br>All four of them were standing immediately under the place on the wall of the museum where, until recently, had hung the portrait of Sir Francis Edward Petherton Filligree, 4th Baronet, of Tolmie Park, near Berebury. The oil painting had been cut neatly from its ornate gilt frame. Along the lower edge of the frame was inscribed in black letters the subject&#x2019;s name and dates. Above this now in the place of the portrait was just an old wooden backing board.<br>Detective Inspector Sloan turned over a new page in his notebook and wrote down the place, date and time. &#x2018;Would this have been a particularly valuable painting, sir?&#x2019;<br>The curator threw out his chest. &#x2018;We have many more important pieces here in the museum naturally, but any portrait by Peter de Vesey has its own value.&#x2019;<br>&#x2018;Who he?&#x2019; asked Detective Constable Crosby insouciantly.<br>Marcus Fixby-Smith favoured him with the pained expression of an expert talking to a total ignoramus. &#x2018;A well-known local artist, very popular with the eighteenth-century landed classes of Calleshire.&#x2019;<br>&#x2018;He painted most of them in his day,&#x2019; put in Hilary Collins helpfully. &#x2018;We&#x2019;ve got several more works by the same artist in our collection here and there are some others over in the Calleshire museum and Art Gallery.&#x2019;<br>&#x2018;We have the best ones, though,&#x2019; put in Fixby-Smith quickly.<br>Sloan, who could recognise a turf war as well as the next man, tried another tack. &#x2018;Would you care to put a value on what has been stolen?&#x2019;<br>&#x2018;Impossible,&#x2019; declared Fixby-Smith histrionically.<br>&#x2018;Not easy,&#x2019; explained Hilary Collins. &#x2018;De Vesey portraits so seldom come on the market these days. Families that have them do like to hang onto them, you know.&#x2019;<br>&#x2018;Ancestor-worship,&#x2019; said Detective Constable Crosby under his breath.<br>&#x2018;So why haven&#x2019;t the Filligrees still got Sir Francis?&#x2019; enquired Sloan mildly.<br>&#x2018;I think it could just be because there aren&#x2019;t any of them left. Filligrees, I mean,&#x2019; said Hilary Collins. &#x2018;But I don&#x2019;t know that for sure.&#x2019;<br>&#x2018;Perhaps they were broke and had to flog him off,&#x2019; put in Crosby. &#x2018;Like selling the family silver.&#x2019;<br>The museum curator grimaced. &#x2018;Worse, we might even have been given him. Then we&#x2019;d have had to have him &#x2013; I mean, it &#x2013; whether we liked it or not.&#x2019; Since this didn&#x2019;t quite accord with his earlier stance he added hastily. &#x2018;Of course, we&#x2019;re always pleased to have anything by Peter de Vesey. Naturally.&#x2019;<br>More practically, Hilary Collins said, &#x2018;I turned up our Accession List before you arrived, Inspector, and it looks as if the portrait came into our collection at some time in the late nineteen-thirties. We have it in our records as having got it on long term loan from the family.&#x2019;<br>&#x2018;There would have been very little market for this sort of work just before the war,&#x2019; put in the museum curator authoritatively. &#x2018;Things were very flat in that field then.&#x2019;<br>&#x2018;They were hard times,&#x2019; said Sloan, who had his grandparents&#x2019; memories of those years to go on.<br>&#x2018;And I believe the Army requisitioned the house in the war...&#x2019; said Hilary Collins.<br>&#x2018;Harder times still,&#x2019; said Sloan. That he&#x2019;d learnt from his own parents.<br>&#x2018;Then after the war,&#x2019; she resumed, &#x2018;I understand the authorities used it for a while to house delinquent children...&#x2019;<br>It would be a toss-up, thought Sloan, whether they would have done more or less damage than the rough soldiery. &#x2018;And then?&#x2019; he asked.<br>&#x2018;I have an idea tat at one time someone wanted to carve the place up into self-contained flats but keeping the fa�ade and the style,&#x2019; replied Hilary Collins. &#x2018;That was after the delinquent children.&#x2019;<br>&#x2018;You know the sort of thing, Inspector,&#x2019; the curator interrupted her, &#x2018;grand country house living without having to worry about the roof or the drive all on your own.&#x2019;<br>&#x2018;I do,&#x2019; said Sloan. They knew all about the aspirational society in the criminal investigation world, too.<br>&#x2018;Delusions of grandeur, if you ask me,&#x2019; muttered Crosby.<br>&#x2018;And then there was a rumour about having a golf course there.&#x2019; Hilary Collins frowned. &#x2018;I rather think something went wrong with a bank loan at that stage but that was only hearsay. I&#x2019;m not sure.&#x2019;<br>&#x2018;So?&#x2019; asked Sloan, mindful of more important problems than a break-in and the history of an old building awaiting him back at the police station. Bank loans that had gone wrong were not exactly hot news there either.<br>&#x2018;I expect the planning people wouldn&#x2019;t wear any development,&#x2019; said Fixby-Smith. &#x2018;Listed building status and all that. All they ever want is for everything to stay &#x201c;as is&#x201d;. Still do.&#x2019;<br>&#x2018;Then?&#x2019; asked Sloan patiently.<br>Hilary Collins screwed up her eyes in the effort of recollection. &#x2018;After that I think it was empty for a long while &#x2013; got thoroughly neglected. The damp got in and then wet rot.&#x2019;<br>&#x2018;Disgraceful,&#x2019; said Fixby-Smith automatically.<br>&#x2018;I have an idea the local council tried to serve repair notices on the owners but they couldn&#x2019;t find them.&#x2019;<br>&#x2018;Neither could the bank, I expect,&#x2019; put in Crosby.<br>&#x2018;No responsibility, some people,&#x2019; said Fixby-Smith.<br>&#x2018;No money, more like,&#x2019; offered Detective Constable Crosby, who lived nearer the ground.<br>&#x2018;I heard that a rather dodgy printing firm moved in after that,&#x2019; said Hilary Collins steadily. &#x2018;They put one of their heavy presses in the old billiard room &#x2013; that sort of thing but who they paid their rent to, I couldn&#x2019;t say.&#x2019;<br>&#x2018;If they did,&#x2019; said Crosby.<br>The curator gave a snort and said, &#x2018;Disgraceful, when you come to think about it. Pure sacrilege.&#x2019;<br>&#x2018;Needs must,&#x2019; contributed Crosby. &#x2018;Or the march of progress or something.&#x2019;<br>Fixby-Smith looked at the detective constable as if he was seeing him for the first time. &#x2018;I may say that if that&#x2019;s what you are pleased to call progress, Constable, then...&#x2019;<br>&#x2018;Sir,&#x2019; Detective Inspector Sloan interrupted him swiftly, turning away from the blank space on the wall where the portrait had been and pointing instead at the damaged display cabinet below it. &#x2018;Do you know what will have been in that?&#x2019;<br>The curator frowned. &#x2018;Anglo-Saxon artefacts, I think. That right, Hilary?&#x2019;<br>&#x2018;Yes, Mr Fixby-Smith. Local ones from the site near Larking. Part of the Professor Michael Ripley bequest.&#x2019; She advanced on the display case and peered in. &#x2018;I know there was a bronze shield in it &#x2013; yes, that&#x2019;s still here. I&#x2019;d have to check the other items in our records to see if anything is missing.&#x2019;<br>&#x2018;That&#x2019;s the Dark Ages, isn&#x2019;t it?&#x2019; said Detective Constable Crosby chattily. &#x2018;The Anglo-Saxons, I mean.&#x2019;<br>The curator immediately launched into hortative mode. &#x2018;Calleshire was quite an important place in post-Roman times. There was a big Anglo-Saxon settlement over Larking way and another one near Almstone, both excavated by the late Professor Michael Ripley, a well-known local archaeologist.&#x2019; He waved an arm. &#x2018;There is some suggestion that the name relates to the re-use by the Anglo-Saxons of Roman stone there beside the river Alm.&#x2019;<br>&#x2018;Waste not, want not,&#x2019; observed Detective Constable Crosby to no one in particular.<br>Detective Inspector Sloan who, among other problems, had a complicated case of transactional fraud on his hands back at the police station, returned to the matter in hand. &#x2018;As you will know, sir,&#x2019; he said to the curator, &#x2018;there are well-established mechanisms for informing the art world of thefts such as these...&#x2019;<br>&#x2018;Yes, yes,&#x2019; Marcus Fixby-Smith interrupted him testily, &#x2018;the Art Loss Register, but I want that portrait back and I also want to know why it has been stolen.&#x2019;<br>&#x2018;So do we,&#x2019; Sloan reassured him.

They embody our society&#x2019;s genetic code. In the masterful hands of the subject&#x2019;s greatest living historian, the story of the evolution of our laws serves to lay bare the deciding struggles over power and justice that have shaped this country from its birth pangs to the present. <b>Law in America</b> is a supreme example of the historian&#x2019;s art, its brevity a testament to the great elegance and wit of its composition.</p><p>Although, in the eyes of many, the law "moves slowly and sluggishly" behind society's advances, Lawrence M. Friedman, in <i>Law in America</i>, a historical overview from colonial times to the present, posits that this is an "illusion." As surely as culture creates law, law creates culture. The American legal system--a bubbling m�lange of common ("judge-made") and civil (derived from codes) law--is a "complicated beast," born of thousands of political entities. Originally a "crude and stripped down" descendant of English law, American law in the 19th century was often an instrument of "economic promotion." In the 20th century, with the rise of a national economy, an evermore heterogeneous population, waning federalism, and the rise of what Friedman calls the "administrative-welfare state," the law daily reached further, into the jurisdiction of civil rights of all stripes, product liability, malpractice, and environmental and antitrust considerations. Friedman's chapters on the colonial period and family law are strong, while his look at the contemporary legal climate drifts toward a general discussion of political and social mores. <i>--H. O'Billovich</i>&#x201c;<b>Law in America</b> is a little gem. It is a peerless introduction to our legal history&#x2014;concise, clear, tellingly told, and beautifully written. The greatest living historian of American law has done it again.&#x201d;<br><b>&#x2014;Stanley N. Katz,</b><br>former president of the American Society for Legal History and the Organization of American Historians<br><br>&#x201c;All societies have laws, but neither all laws nor all legal systems are alike. No one has thought more deeply or written more clearly about the peculiar role of law in American life than Lawrence Friedman. In this trenchant, illuminating book, he distills a lifetime of scholarship and teaching into a concise and provocative explanation of the role that law has played in shaping the distinctive contours of American history and culture.&#x201d;<br><b>&#x2014;David M.

But none of it would happen without the dealers-the tastemakers who back emerging artists and steer them to success, often to see them picked off by a rival. <br><br>Dealers operate within a private world of handshake agreements, negotiating for the highest commissions. Michael Shnayerson, a longtime contributing editor to Vanity Fair, writes the first ever definitive history of their activities. He has spoken to all of today's so-called mega dealers-Larry Gagosian, David Zwirner, Arne and Marc Glimcher, and Iwan Wirth-along with dozens of other dealers-from Irving Blum to Gavin Brown-who worked with the greatest artists of their times: Jackson Pollock, Andy Warhol, Cy Twombly, and more. <br><br>This kaleidoscopic history begins in the mid-1940s in genteel poverty with a scattering of galleries in midtown Manhattan, takes us through the ramshackle 1950s studios of Coenties Slip, the hipster locations in SoHo and Chelsea, London's Bond Street, and across the terraces of Art Basel until today. Now, dealers and auctioneers are seeking the first billion-dollar painting. It hasn't happened yet, but they are confident they can push the price there soon.<br><br></p><p><b>Michael Shnayerson </b>is a long-time contributing editor to Vanity Fair and the author of eight books on a range of non-fiction subjects, from biographies of entertainer Harry Belafonte (<i>My Song</i>) and New York governor Andrew Cuomo (<i>The Contender</i>) to narrative-driven accounts of drug-resistant bacteria (<i>The Killer Within</i>) and mountaintop coal removal (<i>Coal River</i>). Shnayerson is married to Gayfryd Steinberg, and lives in Sag Harbor and Manhattan."The narrative is packed with scrumptious anecdotes and revealing portraits of key players and artists... In this rich, superbly nuanced history, Shnayerson fully demonstrates that he has his finger on the financial pulse of modern art."&#x2015;<b><i><b><i>Kirkus,</i> Starred Review</b></i></b><br><br>"Focusing on personalities as much as business development, Shnayerson's writing is conversational and accessible, even for those without deep art knowledge. Fast-paced and eye-opening, this is a wildly entertaining business history."&#x2015;<b><i><b><i>Publishers Weekly</i></b></i></b><br><br>"In <i>Boom</i>, Michael Shnayerson masterfully traces the blaze-like contemporary art market back to what now seem like unassuming origins. He tells how, somewhere along the way, dealers persuaded the rest of the art world that what they were looking at was not as important as why they were looking at it. And the why, as it turns out, was money."&#x2015;<b><i><b>Graydon Carter, former editor of <i>Vanity Fair</i> and founder of <i>Air Mail</i> newsletter</b></i></b><br><br>"How did the art world-the rarefied, decorous realm of a few hundred in the 1960s-become the art market? Michael Shnayerson penetrates the mysterious conclave of taste, style and money in this sparkling, high-octane account. It's all here and beautifully bound together, from Lucien Freud's gambling debts to the AIDS epidemic to private museums to the magical question of whether the artist makes the dealer or the dealer the artist."&#x2015;<b><i><b>Stacy Schiff, author of <i>Cleopatra: A Life </i>and </b><i><b>The Witches: Salem, 1692</b></i></i></b><br><br>"<i>Boom </i>reflects better than anything I have read the characters, the motives, and the overall vibe of the contemporary art world."&#x2015;<b><i><b>Daniel Weiss, President and CEO of the Metropolitan Museum of Art</b></i></b><br><br>"The high end of the contemporary art market is driven by branding, backstories, mega dealers, art fairs, art investment funds, and occasionally, a hugely talented artist. Most important, it is driven by people. Michael Shnayerson has done the best job I know in pulling all these together. Think of the book as a 400-page <i>Vanity Fair</i> article (where he is a longtime contributing editor). I offer that comparison as a compliment to its style and depth of detail. <br><br> He has captured profiles of the mega-dealers: Gagosian, Zwirner, Wirth, and the Glimchers; the billionaire collectors; and the lawsuits, with background and astute observations. My own books on the contemporary art market would have been much improved this had come earlier.

Written and published first by Antoine de St-Exup�ry in 1943, only a year before his plane disappeared on a reconnaissance flight, it is one of the world's most widely translated books, enjoyed by adults and children alike. In the meeting of the narrator who has ditched his plane in the Sahara desert, and the little prince, who has dropped there through time and space from his tiny asteroid, comes an intersection of two worlds, the one governed by the laws of nature, and the other determined only by the limits of imagination. The world of the imagination wins hands down, with the concerns of the adult world often shown to be lamentably silly as seen through the eyes of the little prince. While adult readers can find deep meanings in his various encounters, they can also be charmed back to childhood by this wise but innocent infant.<p></p> This popular translation contains the author's own delightful illustrations, bringing to visual life the small being at the tale's heart, and a world of fantasy far removed from any quotidian reality. It is also a sort of love story, in which two frail beings, the downed pilot and the wandering infant-prince who has left behind all he knows, share their short time together isolated from humanity and finding sustenance in each other. This is a book which creates a unique relationship with each reader, whether child or adult.<p></p></p><p>Manuela Adreani has worked as a graphic artist and animator.

It's a powerful method for developing compassion of the most tranformative kind, and its supreme expression is found in the classic text <i>The Great Path of Awakening </i>by Jamgon Kongtr�l. This book is Dzigar Kongtr�l's commentary on that beloved text, based on a series of talks he gave on it.

But then, neither are a father&#x2019;s fury and a well-worn leather strap. Unfortunately, these two unpleasant circumstances found themselves on a collision course one very hot Arkansas summer afternoon in 1949. <br>While desperately trying to avoid yet another stultifying day of picking cotton boles for his father&#x2014;when he had instead been promised that he could go to a movie&#x2014;young Glen Campbell hatched a plan to hide under the front porch of his family&#x2019;s dilapidated Arkansas country shack. <br>&#x201c;Glen Travis Campbell, where <i>are</i> you?&#x201d; he heard his father bellow. <br>Filled with thoughts about the terrible beating he would receive if caught, Glen stayed as quiet as a mouse after he deftly slid through broken latticework on the side of the porch. As he silently lay on his belly watching his father&#x2019;s scuffed boots come within inches of his face, he wriggled even farther into the dank, welcoming darkness, ending up in a corner area littered with old cans, empty bottles, and at least one discarded shoe. Thinking that he&#x2019;d finally made it to a safe haven where no one could find him, he let out a small sigh of relief. <br>Soon, however, Glen sensed that maybe he wasn&#x2019;t quite so alone after all. As he turned to his left, the faint shafts of sunlight filtering through the porch&#x2019;s warped wooden floorboards caught the image of what he thought at first to be a coil of rope, until the coil suddenly moved. Staring him in the face was a chicken snake, its tongue flicking in and out. The same kind of snake he&#x2019;d seen devour dozens of rats, mice, and other barnyard critters over the years. Maybe the kind of snake that eats little boys, too, he thought. Trying to scramble as fast as he could to the outside world, Glen raised his head again and again, each time smashing it into the floorboards above. The sounds cracked out into the hot summer air. <br>Hearing all the racket and fearing that a wild animal was under the porch, his mother came running out the front door. His sisters screamed in hysteria. Glen&#x2019;s father squinted underneath the house, wondering what was going on. <br>As Campbell fought the fight of his life to extricate himself from the imaginary clutches of a startled snake that was, in all likelihood, heading in the opposite direction just as quickly, his head appeared turtle-like from underneath the porch. While his eyes slowly adjusted to the bright sunlight, he noticed that his father curiously appeared to be standing on only one foot. Even in all the chaos, Glen wondered why that would be. The answer came quickly, as his father&#x2019;s other boot-encased foot came down firmly on Glen&#x2019;s neck, pinning him in place. <br>&#x201c;Boy, what were you doing under the house?&#x201d; <br>Deciding that his punishment would be less severe if he told the truth, Glen managed to sputter, through tears and a mouthful of dirt, &#x201c;I was hiding from doing my chores.&#x201d; <br>With that, his enraged father yanked Glen out of the dirt, bent him over, and pulled out a length of leather used to attach horses to a wagon. He then proceeded to administer a vicious whipping that seemed to go on forever. Even Glen&#x2019;s mother and sisters had to turn away. <br>At that moment, with each snap of the strap, Glen Campbell became more determined to break away someday, to become his own man. There had to be a better life than being whipped like a mad animal. There just had to be. <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* <br>As five-year-old Carol Smith sat alone in her father&#x2019;s vintage Ford Model A sedan outside the Elks Club in Everett, Washington, she suddenly felt the hair on her tiny arms stand straight up. <br>Through the open windows of the aging, long-out-of-production car, Smith could clearly hear the sounds of her father&#x2019;s Dixieland band playing inside the large building. Even for a child quite accustomed to listening to plenty of music around the house&#x2014;courtesy of two professional musician parents&#x2014;this particular instance somehow rose to another level. This time it <i>moved</i> her. Just listen to that music, she thought, the sheer power of it all. The experience proved to be a defining moment, creating a feeling deep within the little girl that she would never forget. <br>At its peak, the Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks in Everett boasted more than five thousand card-carrying members, a full one-sixth of the approximately thirty thousand people then living in this mid-sized mill town just north of Seattle. And for the better part of the twentieth century, the Spanish mission&#x2013;style club located at 2731 Rucker Avenue in the downtown area was <i>the</i> place to be. There, at the indisputable hub of civic life, members experienced a sense of belonging, fellowship, and, especially, entertainment. <br>Big-name stars of the day like Sammy Davis Jr., Sophie Tucker, and George Gobel routinely played shows at the lodge. Local dances, too, were very popular, sometimes stretching into the early-morning hours. And virtually any area musical ensemble worth watching graced the Elks Club&#x2019;s stage at one time or another, including the group Carol Smith&#x2019;s dad played in. <br>Clyde Smith never did make a lot of money. He had spent the better part of his professional career playing trombone in a World War I military band, various Dixieland bands, and assorted theater orchestras. His wife, Dot, a ragtime and classical pianist, had worked during the Twenties providing piano accompaniment in silent movie houses. Even with two incomes, however, money had always been tight. Betting your livelihood on the instability of being a live musician often meant going without; that was the unfortunate part of the bargain. Decent-paying gigs could be few and far between. Squeaking by became a way of life. And then, during the heart of the Great Depression, along came their only child, Carol, in 1935. <br>As 1941 drew to a close, Clyde and Dot finally decided they had endured enough of the seemingly endless overcast skies and low pay of the Puget Sound region. At over forty years of age, Clyde Smith was too old to fight, but there had to be some good jobs in the Southern California shipyards with the nation at war, now that Pearl Harbor had been attacked. <br>They pointed their car due south with their six-year-old daughter and what few possessions they had and headed down U.S. Highway 99 for sunny climes and hoped-for opportunities. Maybe Los Angeles could even use another good musician or two. Any way they looked at it, a little change would be good for the Smith family. <br>But for Carol Smith, a shy little girl with a pronounced stutter and a blossoming love for all things music, the twelve-hundred-mile trip would prove to be the move of a lifetime. <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* <br>At first, no one smelled the smoke. <br>It was a typically hot and sticky July afternoon in Hartford, Connecticut, the kind of oppressively muggy weather some of the locals liked to call the devil&#x2019;s dew. Barely a month before, Allied forces had finally landed on the beaches of Normandy, giving rise to hope that World War II might actually end one day soon. <br>A seemingly endless stream of happy, sweltering townspeople excitedly walked along leafy Kensington Street toward the northern edge of the city, many with great anticipation clearly evident on their faces. For the circus&#x2014;yes, the circus!&#x2014;had just come to town and the first performance of the seventy-third annual Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey spectacular was about to begin at precisely 3:00 P.M. With wartime rationing still in full effect and live entertainment options in short supply, the yearly visit by &#x201c;The Greatest Show on Earth&#x201d; was simply not to be missed. <br>Close to eight thousand circus goers, including a large number of children on summer vacation, descended upon the bustling bluff-top lot, passing by assorted animal cages, portable dressing rooms, and rail cars as they made their way toward the ticket booth and, most important, the fabled big top beyond. Stilt walkers, lion tamers, and bearded ladies, too, meandered about the grass-covered Barbour Street grounds, patiently waiting for their time in the spotlight. <br>Entering the arena one by one, the lengthy line of buzzing patrons slowly climbed up row after steep row of temporary wooden bleachers in order to find their seats, all strategically arrayed around the interior perimeter of the massive oval portable tent. <br>From every walk of life they came, sitting elbow-to-elbow, filling the arena to beyond fire code capacity. A little dark-haired Italian girl of about ten sat in the front row, methodically licking her ice-cream cone. An elderly gent in red suspenders and a black bowler hat, rhythmically tamping the tobacco in his meerschaum pipe, said to no one in particular, &#x201c;I hear this is their best show yet.&#x201d; <br>Some had great views; others sat in the so-called peanut gallery near the top. But no one cared&#x2014;it was the circus and that was all that mattered. <br>While the twenty-man Ringling Bros. band launched into its first notes of fanfare, a procession of colorfully attired clowns, packed improbably into miniature cars, began to slowly wend its way inside the cavernous canvas-covered structure, closely followed by a variety of elephants, giraffes, acrobats, and, of course, the ringmaster himself. An army of snack vendors, too, in red-and-white-striped jackets, began to fan out, offering peanuts, popcorn, and cotton candy to anyone within earshot. The big show had begun. <br>Unfortunately, as transfixed as they were by the sights and sounds of the world&#x2019;s biggest three-ring circus&#x2014;particularly by the Flying Wallendas, who were in mid-act on the high wire&#x2014;only a scattered few in the rapt audience initially noticed a small flicker of flames and puff of smoke beginning to rise from an area over by the back service-entry flap. <br>Bandleader Merle Evans, always keenly observant, was among the first who did notice. Raising his baton, he instinctively instructed his musicians to quickly switch into playing &#x201c;The Stars and Stripes Forever,&#x201d; the traditional song to alert circus personnel to possible danger. Hearing the cue, the acts suddenly stopped performing and swiftly leaped into action, some rushing to throw water at the small fire, others trying to calm a growing number of concerned and bewildered audience members. <br>A fifteen-year-old boy named Harold Belsky noticed the flames, too. He had arrived just in time for the start of the show and had positioned himself, as always, immediately adjacent to the bandstand in order to closely watch every movement the drummer made. As a fledgling percussionist, Hal (as his family called him) hoped to learn as much as possible from every musical act that passed through town, the circus included. <br>With Belsky coming from a poor background in the Hartford ghetto, watching the pros play in person&#x2014;major Big Band stick men like Gene Krupa, Dave Tough, and Buddy Rich&#x2014;had become one of the only affordable methods of instruction he could manage. Even more than that, they were his heroes, the coolest of the cool, the original hepcats. Hal loved to dream of taking their places onstage, sitting behind a big, gleaming kit with his name stenciled on the front, driving the band with every hit of his snare and every thump of his bass drum. And he sure wasn&#x2019;t going anywhere on this day because of a little bit of smoke. Forget that. The circus had good musicians and he wanted to see them. This was his education. Besides, from where he sat, the fire looked relatively minor anyway. Like many others, he assumed it would be extinguished within a matter of minutes, and he paid it little further heed. Hal Belsky, the young drummer-to-be, put his feet up, settled back, and patiently waited for the show to resume. <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* <br>Growing up poor during the late Forties in tiny Billstown, Arkansas, presented far more challenges, of course, for a youngster like Glen Campbell than just the occasional run-in with a wayward snake. Food was scarce and money even scarcer. Large families of twelve like the Campbells were the norm&#x2014;free labor to help cultivate what few crops they had. For the children, eking out a meager life on a dirt farm meant a whole lot of family chores and very little emphasis on schooling. Most folks in Pike County were lucky to have had an eighth-grade education. Fewer still graduated from high school. When it came down to eating versus reading, the stomach usually had the stronger vote. <br>As for when he did get to school, Glen showed little natural interest in sitting behind a wooden desk. Always energetic and outgoing, he much preferred to spend his nonworking time, when he had any, roughhousing with friends, sneaking into the Saturday afternoon picture show, and playing music. Especially playing music. <br>From the time almost anyone could remember, Glen showed a preternatural aptitude for anything to do with a musical instrument. By the age of ten he&#x2019;d ably learned to pluck notes and strum chords&#x2014;all by ear, no less&#x2014;on a cheap five-dollar acoustic guitar that his father had purchased for him from the Sears &amp; Roebuck catalog. Hum a song for him once and he&#x2019;d likely play it right back to you, often with an improvised flourish of his own tacked on for good measure. He also had a lovely tenor voice with perfect pitch and he delighted in singing gospel hymns at church every Sunday. Playing and singing came easily to him and he particularly enjoyed the attention it could bring. <br>By the age of thirteen, with Glen struggling mightily to keep from failing the seventh grade, an answer to his prayers appeared. His uncle Eugene &#x201c;Boo&#x201d; Campbell, an accomplished, if somewhat itinerant, professional guitar player, came to ask the family a question: could Glen go on the road with him, make a little money to send home, and have an adventure? <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve got some club dates lined up between here and Wyoming and I need a second guitar player. The boy would make a good one.&#x201d; <br>Glen was ecstatic. Compared to the life he&#x2019;d experienced to that point, the prospect of becoming a real live guitarist alongside his beloved uncle Boo was nothing short of manna from heaven. Thank you, Jesus! No more beatings. No more endless chores. No more senseless schoolwork. And, especially, no more long nights spent lying on his stomach while pressing his fist into his gut, trying to quell the gnawing pangs of hunger. <br>And so, with hugs all around and a wave to his family, Glen Campbell hit the road to begin the journey of a lifetime. It would be a long journey, longer than most people think, but a little bit of luck and a whole lot of hard work would serve to take him further than even he could ever imagine possible. <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* <br>Unfortunately for Carol Smith and her parents, things did not work out exactly as planned after the big move to Southern California.

Back in the early 1960s, Fort Worth was still the Wild West. There was no shortage of honky-tonks. The city was a haven for hustlers who&#x2019;d mastered the art of living outside the law. Gangsters controlled the bookie joints, the brothels and most of the nightspots. In the midst of all this, I was struggling to get my career off the ground. Actually &#x201c;career&#x201d; is too fancy a word. I was a just a broke-ass picker looking to make a living making music. Running every which way&#x2014;haunting the beer joints that hid in the shadows of the stockyards, soliciting the club owners who ran the buckets of blood out on Jacksboro Highway&#x2014;I was getting no- where fast. I did manage to get a gig deejaying on KCNC, but that didn&#x2019;t last. Neither did my half-baked attempts to peddle Kirby vacuum cleaners and Encyclopedia Americanas. Proud to say, I was no good at convincing people&#x2014;especially hard-working people&#x2014; to buy stuff they didn&#x2019;t need. What I needed was a break.</p><p>And a break meant a hit song. I didn&#x2019;t care if I sang it or someone else did. If I found a bandleader who liked what I&#x2019;d written, I&#x2019;d sell my tune for the price of dinner. That&#x2019;s how desperate I was. Yet in the midst of my desperation, I also saw that others were more desperate than me. Which is where this story begins.</p><p>A week before Christmas, I was determined to get into the holiday spirit. Wasn&#x2019;t easy because my wife was singing the blues about bills we couldn&#x2019;t pay. We were living in a cramped two-room apartment with our three little ones. Most nights I was gone, looking for places to play my music, and by the time I got home, the kids were up and my wife was off to her waitress job. On this particular morning, two days before Christmas, my mother-in-law was good enough to watch the children while I drove downtown for some last-minute shopping. But, as luck would have it, my beat-up Ford Fairlane wouldn&#x2019;t start, the battery dead as a doornail. So I caught the bus.</p><p>I was freezing. The heater on the bus was busted, and my plaid wool jacket, which had seen better days, couldn&#x2019;t keep me warm. But what the hell. I was happy because last night I&#x2019;d found a barroom&#x2014;Big Bill&#x2019;s on Main Street near the slaughterhouses&#x2014;where I could sing some of my songs. Folks liked what they heard and I wound up with twenty-five dollars&#x2019; worth of tips in my pocket, a minor miracle. It was just the sort of encouragement that I needed to keep going. So today I wasn&#x2019;t bothered by the gray sky. Last night&#x2019;s tips told me that beyond the gray, the sun was shining. Besides, cold can be exhilarating. Best of all, snow was in the forecast, meaning that my kids might get to enjoy their first white Christmas.</p><p>I got off at Houston Street in the middle of down- town. The sidewalks were crowded with shoppers, men in fedoras and long overcoats, women in furs, kids bundled up with scarves and mittens. The store windows were decorated with wreaths and poinsettias. I could see my breath in the frosty air. Already a few flakes had begun to fall. Everyone&#x2019;s expectations were high. Everyone&#x2019;s heart was full. A&nbsp;beautiful&nbsp;Christmas was just around the corner&#x2014;a Christmas when,at least for a day, we could forget our troubles and enjoy simple fellowship with family and friends.</p><p>Up ahead was Leonard&#x2019;s, the mammoth depart- ment store that took up six city blocks, the establish- ment that advertised ONE-STOP SHOPPING WITH MORE MERCHANDISE FOR LESS MONEY. During the holidays, Leonard&#x2019;s was also famous for installing a Santa Claus monorail and an elaborate Toyland department. When it came to Christmas cheer, Leonard&#x2019;s was the spot.</p><p>But then, all of a sudden, a few steps down from the store&#x2019;s main entrance, I saw someone who stopped me in my tracks: A man, whose legs had been amputated above his knees, supporting himself on a large wooden board resting on four wheels. The board not only held the man, but an array of neatly arranged products that he was selling&#x2014;wrapping paper, pencils and ribbons. In addition to the traditional Christmas colors of green and red, his merchandise also came in blue, orange, purple and yellow. He easily moved around the board, supporting himself with his long strong arms.</p><p><i>&#x201c;Pretty paper!&#x201d;</i> he sang out in a strong and emotional voice, <i>&#x201c;pretty ribbons of blue . . . wrap your presents to your darling from you . . . pretty pencils to write &#x2018;I love you.&#x2019;&#x201d;</i></p><p>He sang like he meant it. In fact, he sang like a singer. He sang in tune. Sadly, he also seemed to be singing in vain. I didn&#x2019;t see a single person stop to buy his wares. And yet that didn&#x2019;t stop his singing. I sensed that he sang to lift his spirits and stay warm. I stood about nine or ten feet away from him, off to one side, so he wouldn&#x2019;t see me studying him.</p><p>What I saw was a man who looked to be roughly my age&#x2014;in his early thirties&#x2014;a handsome man with chestnut brown eyes and a brown beard covering his square-jawed face. He had a broad nose and thick eyebrows. He wore a black turtleneck sweater with big gaping holes. His blue jeans, that covered the stumps of his legs, were tattered. Despite his handicap, he projected a sense of confidence and rugged masculinity. As he sang his song peddling his wares, his eyes looked upward&#x2014;above the crowds passing by, above Leonard&#x2019;s Department Store, above the streetlights&#x2014;into a sky filled with snowflakes growing fluffier by the minute. Some of the flakes landed on the man&#x2019;s eyes, melting on his lids and giving the impression that he was crying.</p><p>Was he crying? Was he distraught that no one found the time to stop and inquire about him or his colorful merchandise? I wanted to stop. I wanted to ask how he came to be doing what he was doing. How had he lost his legs? His deep brown eyes, wet with snow, suggested some story. But like the others, I did not stop. The Christmas rush was on, and even though I was in no rush at all, I picked up the rhythm of the downtown shoppers. I hurried along. I left the man on the rolling wooden board and rushed into the store.</p><p>I bought perfume for my wife, candy for my mother-in-law, a model train for my son and dolls for my girls. When the sales clerk asked if I wanted them giftwrapped, without thinking I said, &#x201c;Yes, please.&#x201d; But then I changed my mind. I thought of the man selling pretty paper. I wasn&#x2019;t much of a wrapper, but I could figure it out. This guy deserved a break, and buying his goods seemed like the right thing to do. After all, it was Christmas.</p><p>So with my unwrapped gifts, I left Leonard&#x2019;s. Now the snow was coming down hard&#x2014;a rare event in this part of Texas. The wind was kicking up a storm. The temperature had dipped down into single digits. It was hard to see, hard to walk against the howling wind. Folks were hanging on to light poles and the sides of buildings. Looking around, I couldn&#x2019;t see my man. Where had he gone? Maybe he&#x2019;d moved on. Battling the wind, I circled all the way around Leonard&#x2019;s enormous complex. I went up and down the block two, three four times. Something told me I had to find him. But by now I was walking through a virtual blizzard.</p><p>I couldn&#x2019;t look forever. He&#x2019;d probably found shelter in some nearby coffee shop. Or maybe he actually went inside Leonard&#x2019;s to wait out the storm. So I reentered the store where, for the next twenty minutes, I looked from one end to the other. But he was nowhere to be found. I gave up the search. Feeling a little guilty, I went to the clerks who had sold me my gifts and asked that they be wrapped. I was instructed to go the third-floor gift-wrap department. After waiting in line for twenty minutes, I asked the gift wrapper&#x2014;a hefty middle-aged woman wearing a Santa&#x2019;s cap&#x2014;if she knew about the man who sold pretty paper, pen- cils and ribbons on the street outside the store.</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, that bum,&#x201d; she said condescendingly. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s nothing but a nuisance.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;He didn&#x2019;t seem like a bum,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;He sounded like a singer.&#x201d;</p><p>Busy making bows on the packages containing my daughters&#x2019; dolls, the wrapper didn&#x2019;t respond. I&#x2019;m not sure she heard what I said or, if she had, she didn&#x2019;t think it was worth a reply.</p><p>I took the presents and, still looking for the man as I&nbsp;headed&nbsp;for&nbsp;the&nbsp;exit,&nbsp;left&nbsp;Leonard&#x2019;s.&nbsp;Outside,&nbsp;the weather had worsened. With a shopping bag in each hand, I was barely able to fight my way through the wind to the bus stop. Still no peddler in sight. Fortunately the bus came along in a few minutes&#x2014;this one was heated&#x2014;and I took my seat and rode back home.</p><p>We had a nice Christmas. Big Bill&#x2019;s made the difference. I worked there consistently through the holidays,&nbsp;meaning&nbsp;I&nbsp;could&nbsp;pay&nbsp;off&nbsp;some&nbsp;back&nbsp;bills&nbsp;and make peace&#x2014;not to mention a little love&#x2014;with my old lady. The kids loved their presents, my mother-in-law loved her chocolates and I thought if I could keep gigging&nbsp;and&nbsp;save&nbsp;a&nbsp;little&nbsp;money, maybe,&nbsp;just&nbsp; maybe,&nbsp; I could&nbsp; make&nbsp; that&nbsp; move&nbsp; to&nbsp; Nashville,&nbsp; where&nbsp; I&nbsp; might have better luck selling my songs.</p></p><h2>Native American Clothing: An Illustrated History</h2><p><p><b>More than five centuries of native peoples' artistry.</b></p> <p>Native Americans crafted beautiful clothing out of skins, pigment, quills and sinew.

But climate change is not something new, though it has previously run its course beyond the time frames of our human experience. Some 40,000 years ago, as the last ice age was slowly coming to an end, enormous glaciers were retreating northward, followed by large herds of mammoths, wild horses and reindeer. Always following the game, mankind was spreading into Asia from its original residence in warmer regions. Most probably these people protected themselves against the hot sun and windburn by rubbing their bodies with animal grease mixed with red ocher. This ancient means of body protection survived for untold centuries in many parts of the world. Stimulated by a psychological need that animals do not experience, these people adopted various types of body adornment. Body painting and tattooing satisfied vanity and denoted status and prestige long before these roles were taken over by garments.</p> <p>Vaguely noticeable in the shadows of the past, these people gradually spread northward. The need for protection from the cold climate is what first brought about the invention of clothing. Bone awls and needles found in ancient campsites are evidence of the tailored clothing of the hardy hunters. In order to survive on the northern tundra, they wore furs and tanned hides that were sewn with waterproof seams. The need for protection from the cold climate initiated the invention of clothing. Secondary reasons played a role in much later cultural developments. The construction of garments was undoubtedly the work of women, who took care of the camp while the men were out hunting. This gender-based division of labor in daily occupations may have led to the differences in dress between men and women.</p> <p>The nomadic bands, widely scattered in the vast expanse of new land, gradually developed the cultural equipment to survive in the sub-arctic environment of Siberia. While they gathered and dispersed with the seasonal movements of the game herds, some of these people moved east over the course of many generations. Following the game, they entered a wide valley, later called Beringia by our archaeologists. Beringia does not exist anymore; about 14,000 years ago the rising temperatures started to melt the glacial ice, causing the ocean levels to rise. The submerged valley separated Siberia from Alaska and became the present-day Bering Strait. From Siberia, the New World is visible some 55 miles in the distance.</p> <p>As single families and in small bands, people found their way across Beringia, first across the dry land, followed by others across the ice during the long winters, and in later times, in skin-covered boats. For thousands of years the wandering hunters kept coming, unaware they were entering another continent. They merely remembered that their ancestors had once lived in a more eastern valley or beyond the distant mountains. These migrations involved various groups of different physical types who would have been strangers to each other. The earliest immigrants may have represented mankind before the emergence of the modern races; Mongolian features increased among later arrivals.</p> <p>It was probably about 25,000 years ago that the first trickle of these people crossed Beringia, to remain in the ice-free parts of western Alaska for a long time. The interior and all of Canada was still covered by glacial ice. However, about 14,000 years ago, an ice-free route opened up along the Pacific coast, followed by a similar corridor along the eastern flanks of the Rocky Mountains. Along these two routes, the first immigrants moved south. Some daring pioneers appear to have reached present-day Pennsylvania 16,000 years ago; 6,000 years after that, people had reached the southern tip of South America. As periodic markers along this endless river of time, these people left us their stone and bone tools, bark sandals in an Oregon cave, fragments of basketry, and their own bones. These clues tell an increasingly detailed story of a diversity of intelligent ways of life.</p> <p>By 10,000 years ago, scattered populations lived in every corner of North America. The big game of the ice age had vanished and caribou, buffalo, sea mammals and fish became major food sources. While gathering edible wild plants, roots, berries and seeds, some women discovered the germination of such seeds and the growing of plants for food. Horticulture of squash, maize and beans emerged in Central America about 5,000 years ago and spread into the southern parts of North America, enabling the people to settle in permanent villages. The impact of these economic developments is apparent in the garments they wore, particularly in the predominant use of hide clothing by the nomadic hunters and in the woven fiber materials used by the farming people.</p> <p>Europeans may have "discovered" North America several times before Christopher Columbus came ashore, believing he had arrived in India. As a result, we still identify the aboriginal people of North America as "Indians," which is a term equivalent in its generality as the terms "Europeans" or "Africans." With each of these terms we refer to a great variety of different peoples. The description of the Arctic population as "Eskimo" is a mere accident in the history of northern exploration; they are as much part of the North American aboriginal population as the Indians are.</p> <p>Ethnic labels have become a sensitive issue since the 1960s. The term "Native Americans" has become popular in the United States, and Canadian Indian leaders have promoted the term "First Nations."</p> <p>However, official terminology tends to separate itself from the language of ordinary people. In my contacts with Indians, I have found that few of them are interested in such artificial problems. Tony Hillerman once attended an intertribal conference where this tortured subject came up. The verdict of the Indians was unanimous: Indians call each other Indians, unless the name of a specific tribe is in order. One native participant was greatly relieved that Columbus had not thought he had landed on the Virgin Islands! Following the consensus among the people in question, I use the terms "Indian" and "native" interchangeably. In order to avoid confusion for the reader I will also retain the tribal names conventionally used in the literature, though most of these names are the final products of baffling corruptions of native terms.</p> <p>In the early European-contact period of the 1500s, the total population of North America was an estimated 12 million people; these people spoke a greater variety of languages than anywhere else in the world. The more than 500 languages were derived from 12 major language families, as different from each other as German and Chinese. Any possible relationship with languages in Asia has been lost in the many thousand years of separation.</p> <p>The European discovery of North America was a major event in the history of mankind. Never again will we experience such an unexpected meeting with long-lost relatives, not that we our common humanity was immediately recognized. In 1512, the Pope proclaimed that the Indians were children of Adam and Eve, and should be respected as human beings. But the New World was far beyond the control of the Pope and other authorities. What appeared to the Micmac Indians to be bears on a floating island turned out to be bearded white strangers on a big ship. And invariably the European visitors mentioned in their early accounts of the native people that "they go naked except that at the private parts they wear some skins of little animals."</p> <p>In large parts of North America, daily clothing was indeed minimal. Fully tailored or fitted garments were largely restricted to the arctic and subarctic regions. Yet it is in the other regions that we find the most spectacular development of festive or ceremonial dress, revealing the owner's social status, cult membership, military ran</p></p><h2>The Troubled Man</h2><p>A retired navy officer has vanished in a forest near Stockholm. Kurt Wallander is prepared to stay out of the relatively straightforward investigation&#x2014;which is, after all, another detective&#x2019;s responsibility&#x2014;but the missing man is his daughter&#x2019;s father-in-law. <br> &nbsp;<br> With his typical disregard for rules and regulations, Wallander is soon pursuing his own brand of dogged detective work on someone else&#x2019;s case. His methods are often questionable, but the results are not: he finds an extremely complex situation which may involve the secret police and ties back to Cold War espionage. Adding to Wallander&#x2019;s concerns are more personal troubles. Having turned sixty, and having long neglected his health, he&#x2019;s become convinced that his memory is failing. As he pursues this baffling case, he must come to grips not only with the facts at hand, but also with his own troubling situation.</p><p>Henning Mankell&#x2019;s novels have been translated into forty languages and have sold more than thirty million copies worldwide. He is the first winner of the Ripper Award (the new European prize for crime fiction) and has also received the Glass Key and Golden Dagger awards. His Kurt Wallander mysteries were adapted into a PBS television series starring Kenneth Branagh. Mankell divides his time between Sweden and Mozambique.<br><br>www.henningmankell.com1<br><br>The year Kurt Wallander celebrated his fifty-fifth birthday, he fulfilled a long-held dream. Ever since his divorce from Mona fifteen years earlier, he had intended to leave his apartment in Mariagatan, where so many unpleasant memories were etched into the walls, and move out to the country. Every time he came home in the evening after a stressful and depressing workday, he was reminded that once upon a time he had lived there with a family. Now the furniture stared at him as if accusing him of desertion.<br>He could never reconcile himself to living there until he became so old that he might not be able to look after himself anymore. Although he had not yet reached the age of sixty, he reminded himself over and over again of his father's lonely old age, and he knew he had no desire to follow in his footsteps. He needed only to look into the bathroom mirror in the morning when he was shaving to see that he was growing more and more like his father. When he was young, his face had resembled his mother's. But now it seemed as if his father was taking him over-like a runner who has been lagging a long way behind but is slowly catching up the closer he gets to the invisible finish line.<br><br>Wallander's worldview was fairly simple. He did not want to become a bitter hermit growing old in isolation, being visited only by his daughter and perhaps now and then by a former colleague who had suddenly remembered that Wallander was still alive. He had no religious hopes of there being something in store for him on the other side of the black River Styx. There would be nothing but the same darkness that he had once emerged from. Until his fiftieth birthday, he had harbored a vague fear of death, something that had become his own personal mantra-that he <i>would be dead for such a long time</i>. He had seen far too many dead bodies in his life. There was nothing in their expressionless faces to suggest that their souls had been absorbed into some kind of heaven. Like so many other police officers, he had experienced every possible variation of death. Just after his fiftieth birthday had been celebrated with a party and cake at the police station, marked by a speech full of empty phrases by the former chief of police, Liza Holgersson, he had bought a new notebook and tried to record his memories of all the dead people he had come across. It had been a macabre exercise and he had no idea why he had been tempted to pursue it. When he got as far as the tenth suicide, a man in his forties, a drug addict with more or less every problem it was possible to imagine, he gave up. The man had hanged himself in the attic of the condemned apartment building where he lived, hanging in such a way that he was guaranteed to break his neck and hence avoid being slowly choked to death. His name was Welin. The pathologist had told Wallander that the man had been successful-he had proved to be a skillful executioner. At that point Wallander had abandoned his suicide cases and instead stupidly devoted several hours to an attempt to recall the young people or children he had found dead. But he soon gave that up as well. It was too repugnant. Then he felt ashamed of what he had been trying to do and burned the notebook, as if his efforts were both perverted and illegal. In fact, he was basically a cheerful person-it was just that he had allowed another side of his personality to take over.<br><br>Death had been his constant companion. He had killed people in the line of duty-but after the obligatory investigation he had never been accused of unnecessary violence.<br><br>Having killed two people was the cross he had to bear. If he rarely laughed, it was because of what he had been forced to endure.<br>But one day he made a critical decision. He had been out near L�derup, not far from the house where his father used to live, to talk to a farmer who had been the target of a very nasty robbery. On the way back to Ystad he noticed a real estate agent's sign picturing a little dirt road where there was a house for sale. He reacted automatically, stopped the car, turned around, and found his way to the address. Even before he got out of the car it was obvious to him that the property was in need of repair. It had originally been a U-shaped building, the bottom half clad in wood. But now one of the wings was missing-perhaps it had burned down. He walked around the house. It was a day in early fall. He could still remember seeing a skein of geese migrating south, flying directly above his head. He peered in through the windows and soon established that only the roof badly needed to be fixed. The view was enchanting; he could just make out the sea in the far distance, and possibly even one of the ferries on the way to Ystad from Poland. That afternoon in September 2003 marked the beginning of a love story with this remote house.<br><br>He drove straight to the real estate agent's office in the center of Ystad. The asking price was low enough that he would be able to manage the mortgage payments. The very next day he returned to negotiate with the agent, a young man who spoke at breakneck speed and gave the impression of living in a parallel universe. The previous owners were a young couple who had moved to Sk�ne from Stockholm but almost immediately, before they even had time to buy furniture, decided to split up. Yet there was nothing hidden in the walls of the empty house that scared him. And the most important thing was crystal clear: he would be able to move in without delay. The roof would last for another year or two; all he needed to do was to redecorate some of the rooms, perhaps install a new bath and maybe acquire a new stove. But the boiler was less than fifteen years old, and all the plumbing and electrical fittings no older.<br><br>Before leaving, Wallander asked if there were any other potential buyers. There was one, said the agent, looking distinctly worried, as if he really wanted Wallander to get the house but at the same time implying that he had better make his mind up fast. But Wallander had no intention of rushing in blindly. He spoke to one of his colleagues whose brother was a home inspector and managed to arrange for the expert to inspect the house the very next day. He found nothing wrong apart from what Wallander had already noticed. That same day Wallander spoke to his bank manager and was informed that he could rely on a mortgage big enough to buy the house. During all his years in Ystad, Wallander had saved up a lot of money without ever thinking much about it. Enough for the down payment.<br><br>That evening he sat at his kitchen table and made detailed financial calculations. He found the occasion solemn and significant. By midnight he had made up his mind: he would buy the house, which had the dramatic-sounding name of Black Heights. Despite the late hour, he called his daughter, Linda, who lived in a new development just off the main road to Malm�. She was still awake.<br><br>"You must come over," said Wallander excitedly. "I've got news for you."<br><br>"What? In the middle of the night?"<br><br>"I know it's your day off tomorrow."<br><br>It had been a complete surprise to him a few years earlier when, during a walk along the beach at Mossby Strand, Linda told him she had decided to follow in his footsteps and join the police force. It cheered him up instantly. In a way it was as if she was giving new meaning to all the years he had been a police officer. When she finished her training, she was assigned to the Ystad force. The first few months, she lived with him in the apartment in Mariagatan. It was not an ideal arrangement; he was set in his ways, and he also found it hard to accept that she was grown up now. But their relationship was saved when she managed to find an apartment of her own.<br><br>When she arrived in the early hours, he told her what he was planning to do. The next day she accompanied him to the house and said immediately that it was perfect. No other house would do, only this one at the end of a dirt road at the top of a gentle slope down to the sea.<br><br>"Granddad will haunt you," she said. "But you don't need to be afraid. He'll be a sort of guardian angel."<br><br>It was a significant and happy moment in Wallander's life when he signed the contract of sale and suddenly found himself standing there with a bunch of keys in his hand. He moved in on November first, having redecorated two rooms but having refrained from buying a new stove. He left Mariagatan without the slightest doubt that he was doing the right thing. A southeasterly gale was blowing the day he moved in.<br><br>That first evening, with the storm raging, he lost electricity. Wallander sat in his new home in pitch darkness. There was groaning and creaking coming from the rafters, and he discovered a leak in the ceiling. But he had no regrets. This was where he was going to live.<br><br>There was a dog kennel outside the house. Ever since he was a little boy Wallander had dreamed of having a dog. By the time he was thirteen he had given up hope, but out of the blue he got one as a present from his parents. He loved that dog more than anything else in the world. Looking back, it felt like the dog, Saga, had taught him what love could be. When she was three years old, she was run over by a truck. The shock and sorrow were worse than anything he had experienced in his young life. More than forty years later, Wallander had no difficulty recalling all those chaotic emotions. <i>Death strikes</i>, he sometimes thought. It has a powerful and unforgiving fist.<br><br>Two weeks later he acquired a dog, a black Labrador puppy. He wasn't quite a purebred, but he was nevertheless described by the owner as top class. Wallander had decided in advance that the dog would be called Jussi, after the world-famous Swedish tenor who was one of Wallander's greatest heroes.<br>Nearly four years after he bought the house, on January 12, 2007, Wallander's whole life changed in an instant.<br><br>As he stepped out into the hall a few paces behind Kristina Magnusson, whom he liked viewing from behind when nobody was looking, the phone rang in his office. He considered ignoring it, but instead he turned and went back in. It was Linda. She had a few days off, having worked on New Year's Eve, during which Ystad had been unusually lively, with lots of cases of domestic violence and assaults.<br><br>"Do you have a minute?"<br><br>"Not really. We're on the verge of identifying some crooks in a big case."<br><br>"I need to see you."<br><br>Wallander thought she sounded tense. He started to worry, as he always did, that something might have happened to her.<br><br>"Is it anything serious?"<br><br>"Not at all."<br><br>"I can meet you at one o'clock."<br><br>"Mossby Strand beach?"<br><br>Wallander thought she was joking.<br><br>"Should I bring my bathing suit?"<br><br>"I'm serious. Mossby Strand. But no bathing suit."<br><br>"Why do we have to go out there in the cold with this icy wind blowing?"<br><br>"I'll be there at one o'clock. So will you."<br><br>She hung up before he could ask anything else. What did she want? He stood there, trying in vain to think of an answer. Then he went to the conference room with the best television set and sat for two hours going through CCTV camera footage for the case he was working on, the brutal attack and robbery of an elderly arms dealer and his wife. As twelve thirty approached, they were still only halfway through. Wallander stood up and announced that they could review the rest of the tapes after two o'clock. Martinsson, one of the officers Wallander had worked with longest in Ystad, looked at him in surprise.<br><br>"You mean we should stop now? With so much still to do? You don't usually break for lunch."<br><br>"I'm not going to eat. I have an appointment."<br><br>He left the room, thinking that his tone of voice had been unnecessarily sharp. He and Martinsson were not only colleagues, they were also friends. When Wallander threw his housewarming party out at L�derup it was of course Martinsson who gave a speech in praise of him, the dog, and the house. We are like an old hardworking couple, he thought as he left the police station. An old couple who are always bickering, mainly to keep each other on our toes.<br><br>He went to his car, a Peugeot he'd had for the last four years, and drove off. How many times have I driven along this road? How many more times will I drive along it? As he waited for a red light to change, he remembered something his father had told him about a cousin Wallander had never met. His cousin used to be captain of a ferry plying between several islands in the Stockholm archipelago-short trips, no more than five minutes at a time, but year in, year out, the same crossings. One afternoon in October something snapped inside him. The ferry had a full load, but he suddenly changed course and headed straight out to sea. He said later that he knew there was enough diesel in the tank to take him as far as one of the Baltic states. But that was all he said, after he was overpowered by angry passengers and the coast guard raced out to put the ferry back on course. He never explained why he did what he did.<br><br>But in a vague sort of way, Wallander thought he understood him.<br><br>As he drove west along the coast road he could see dark thunderclouds building up on the horizon. The radio had warned that there was a risk of more snow in the evening. Shortly before he passed the side road to Marsvinsholm he was overtaken by a motorcycle. The rider waved at him and made Wallander think of something that frightened him more than anything else: that one of these days Linda would have a motorcycle accident. He had been totally unprepared when, several years earlier, she turned up outside his apartment on her newly bought bike, a Harley- Davidson covered in glittering chrome. His first question when she took off her crash helmet was whether she had lost her mind.<br><br>"You don't know about all my dreams," she had said with a broad, happy grin. "Just as I'm sure I don't know all yours."<br><br>"I don't dream about a motorbike, that's for sure."<br><br>"Too bad. We could have gone for rides together."</p><h2>Darkly: Black History and America&#39;s Gothic Soul</h2><p><b>Leila Taylor takes us into the dark heart of the American gothic, analysing the ways it relates to race in America in the twenty-first century.</b><br><br>Haunted houses, bitter revenants and muffled heartbeats under floorboards -- the American gothic is a macabre tale based on a true story. <br><br>Part memoir and part cultural critique, Darkly: Blackness and America's Gothic Soul explores American culture's inevitable gothicity in the traces left from chattel slavery. The persistence of white supremacy and the ubiquity of Black death feeds a national culture of terror and a perpetual undercurrent of mourning. <br><br>If the gothic narrative is metabolized fear, if the goth aesthetic is romanticized melancholy, what does that look and sound like in Black America?</p><p>Leila Taylor is a former goth kid and current Creative Director at Brooklyn Public Library. She&#39;s given talks at the International Gothic Association and the Morbid Anatomy Museum, has an MFA in Graphic Design from Yale University and an MA in Liberal Studies from The New School of Social Research. This is her first book."I am struck by the depth of Leila Taylor's vision. The generosity shown in the way a history (and present) is illuminated.

Between the black aesthetic of goth culture and the Blackness of America, Leila Taylor navigates seamlessly between cultural critique, personal history, and a history of America's troubled past in writing that is incessant, curious, and generous, and a voice that is at turns both searing and vulnerable.

Clear explanations and helpful paradigms help students learn Hebrew quickly and well. Created for a one-semester course, but easily adaptable for a two-semester course, it includes vocabulary, exercises based on the BHS, English to Hebrew and Hebrew to English wordlists, and an annotated guide to key reference works. A resource CD provides the answers to the exercises as well as audio pronunciation for the Hebrew vocabulary, many of the paradigms and exercises, and select Old Testament readings.<br><br>Jo Ann Hackett's introductory textbook for Biblical Hebrew is exactly what every teacher and student desires: it is well written and easy to read, it isn't cluttered with information unnecessary to the beginning student, and, with its exceptionally clear descriptions, paradigms, and lessons, it is, above all, useful. Perfect for the seminary and the academic setting alike, students will find that this volume, despite�or because of�a few key variations from the conventional approach to teaching Biblical Hebrew, makes learning the language straightforward and easy. With this textbook Prof. Hackett has made her much-lauded teaching style and practices available to a wider audience, and those who take the opportunity to follow her lead will be much rewarded.�Joel S. Baden, Assistant Professor of Old Testament, Yale Divinity School<br><br>In the years I have taught Hebrew, I have found no better grammar for getting students into the way we "do" Hebrew at Harvard. The grammatical explanations are clear and concise, they are ordered in a way to build students' confidence early, and the results are simply incredible. Indeed, after my first year using this grammar the class was able to read so many difficult texts after the single semester that our second year Hebrew course had to be fully redesigned�the students had already read, and mastered, all of the material ordinarily introduced in the second year course. Hackett's work, especially with the CD, will prove to be a valuable teaching tool for faculty and students who choose to follow her proven methods of language learning.-John Lee Ellison, Associate Dean of Harvard College<br><br>This grammar is excellent, by far the best to appear in thirty years.

He is famous for his bestselling novel <i>On the Road</i> and for having spawned the Beat Generation. For some, images of rebellious hipsters come to mind, as well as a beat determination not to revise, first thought best thought. But careful readers of Kerouac&#x2019;s prose recognize that within the ragged, circular, soulful cadences for which his writing is at once criticized, imitated and revered is the rhythmic phrasing of poetry.</p><p>Among the literati who knew him best, Jack Kerouac was a poet supreme who worked in several poetry traditions, including sonnets, odes, psalms, and blues (which he based on blues and jazz idioms). He also successfully adapted haiku into English, his &#x201c;American haikus.&#x201d;1 &#x201c;&#x2018;Haiku,&#x2019;&#x201d; he wrote, &#x201c;was invented and developed over hundreds of years in Japan to be a complete poem in seventeen syllables and to pack in a whole vision of life in three short lines.&#x201d; Finding that Western languages cannot adapt themselves to the &#x201c;fluid syllabillic Japanese,&#x201d; he sought to redefine the genre:</p><p>&#x201c;I propose that the &#x2018;Western Haiku&#x2019; simply say a lot in three short lines in any Western language. Above all, a Haiku must be very simple and free of all poetic trickery and make a little picture and yet be as airy and graceful as a Vivaldi Pastorella. Here is a great Japanese Haiku that is simpler and prettier than any Haiku I could ever write in any language:&#x2014;</p><p></p><p>A day of quiet gladness,&#x2014;</p><p>Mount Fuji is veiled</p><p>In misty rain.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Bash&#x14d;) (1644&#x2013;1694)</p><p></p><p>Thus, in this tradition, Kerouac wrote:</p><p></p><p>Birds singing</p><p>in the dark</p><p>Rainy dawn</p><p></p><p>Kerouac composed this and hundreds more haiku in notebooks dated from 1956 to 1966. These small, bound notebooks&#x2014;the kind he could press into his checkered lumberman&#x2019;s shirt pocket and carry around anywhere for fresh and spontaneous entries&#x2014;contain a huge cache of his three-line jottings, a mother lode, so to speak, from which he selected what would comprise his Book of Haikus, a collection he urged Lawrence Ferlinghetti to publish in 1961. Five Working Notebooks dated 1961&#x2013;1965 are another source of haiku, and more were embedded in novels, letters, or published in small literary magazines. Twenty-six, some chosen for a 1964 anthology of American verse edited by his Italian translator, Fernanda Pivano, were published posthumously in 1971 by City Lights in <i>Scattered Poems.</i> A manuscript page (Berg Collection of the New York Public Library) indicates Kerouac&#x2019;s intentions.</p><p>Jack Kerouac was not the first American poet to experiment in haiku aesthetics. Before him, Ezra Pound, William Carlos Williams, Amy Lowell, and Wallace Stevens all created haiku-inspired verse. It was not until after the Second World War that a &#x201c;rigorous and informed attention to the genre&#x201d;2 arose, with the first volume of R. H. Blyth&#x2019;s four-volume <i>Haiku</i> appearing in 1949, bringing the classical traditions of haiku and Zen to the West.</p><p>Kerouac turned to Buddhist study and practice after his &#x201c;road&#x201d; period, from 1953 until 1956, in the lull between the writing of the seminal <i>On the Road</i> in 1951,2 and its publication in 1957&#x2014;that is, before fame changed everything. When he finished <i>The Subterraneans</i> in the fall of 1953, fed up with the world after the failed love affair on which the book was based, he picked up Thoreau and fantasized a life separate from civilization. Then he happened upon Asvaghosha&#x2019;s <i>The Life of Buddha</i> and immersed himself in Zen study.</p><p>Kerouac began his genre-defying book <i>Some of the Dharma</i> in 1953 as a collection of reader&#x2019;s notes on Dwight Goddard&#x2019;s <i>The Buddhist Bible;</i> the endeavor grew into a massive compilation of spiritual material, meditations, prayers, and haiku, a study of his musings on the teaching of Buddha. By 1955, while living in North Carolina with his sister, he worked on two other Buddhist-related texts: <i>Wake Up,</i> his own biography of the Buddha, and <i>Buddha Tells Us,</i> translations of &#x201c;works done by great Rimbauvian Frenchmen at the Abbeys of Tibet,&#x201d; what he refers to in his letters as &#x201c;a full length Buddhist Handbook.&#x201d;</p><p>Haiku came to the West Coast poets through Gary Snyder. Inspired by D. T. Suzuki&#x2019;s <i>Essays in Zen Buddhism</i> (1927) in the fall of 1951, Snyder spent the early &#x2019;50s traveling in Japan, studying and practicing Zen Buddhism. Philip Whalen and Lew Welch became avid haiku practitioners through his influence. Kerouac, Ginsberg, Snyder, and Whalen spent time together in Berkeley in 1955 talking, drinking, and trading their own versions of Blyth&#x2019;s haiku translations, which they were reading in all four volumes. Through Blyth&#x2019;s translations and his extraordinary commentary on the Japanese works, Kerouac found emotive and aesthetic sympathies. Even though he attempted to meditate, wrote a sutra, &#x201c;The Scripture of the Golden Eternity&#x201d; (1956) at Gary Snyder&#x2019;s behest, and thought of his entire oeuvre, his Legend of Duluoz, as a &#x201c;Divine Comedy&#x201d; based on Buddha,3 Buddhism stayed a literary concern for him, not a meditative or spiritual practice, as it was for Snyder and Whalen. Later, when he told Ted Berrigan in his 1968 <i>Paris Review</i> interview he was a serious Buddhist, but not a Zen Buddhist, the distinction was to separate his interest from the prevalent scholarly study of dogma in favor of Buddhist essence.4 The practice of haiku, however, persisted throughout his life, becoming an important medium for rendering the Beat ideal of &#x201c;shapely mind,&#x201d; and for crafting an American Mysticism in the manner of Thoreau. For a new generation of poets, Kerouac ended up breaking ground at a pioneering stage of an American haiku movement.</p><p>Finding these haiku was a bit like extracting gold from baser metals, so embedded were many of them (nearly 1,000) in blocks of prose, scribble, and even street addresses. Many reappear throughout his work, because Kerouac recycled his haiku, using them in different ways.</p><p>Traditional haiku collections are organized by season or subject, but that did not seem an appropriate way to present Kerouac&#x2019;s haiku. Part I of this volume is comprised of haiku he selected himself. The chronological organization of the haiku in Part II seemed the best way to give a sense of the evolution of the work, as well as to see each poem in its own light. Handy for this approach, Kerouac, in a 1963 journal, divided up his life according to the seasonal haiku reference, and so, following his idea, I have taken Spring and Summer as the period before the publication of <i>On the Road,</i> Autumn and Winter as after, in his later years.5</p><p>This book endeavors to include examples of the entire range of Kerouac&#x2019;s haiku&#x2014;those which he selected for publication (The Book of Haikus found in a black folder so named) and poems in those subcategories by which he experimented in haiku possibilities: the philosophical &#x201c;pops&#x201d; as well as the angry, emotionally blunt &#x201c;beat generation haikus.&#x201d; As with all of Kerouac&#x2019;s work in prose and poetry, process is key to his search for more refined language.</p><p>Allen Ginsberg spoke perhaps hyperbolically of Kerouac as the &#x201c;only <i>master</i> of the haiku: He&#x2019;s the only one in the United States who knows how to write haiku .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. [he] talks that way, thinks that way.&#x201d;6 What Kerouac &#x201c;got&#x201d; perhaps more than any other Beat poet working in this genre was the rendering of a subject&#x2019;s essence, and the shimmering, ephemeral nature of its fleeting existence. This sensitivity to impermanence appears again and again in his work, from <i>The Town and the City,</i> constructed around the death of the father, through <i>The Book of Dreams,</i> which evokes the frail individual beset with a harsh, indifferent society, at times succumbing, defeated.</p><p>One of Kerouac&#x2019;s classic haiku images is of a sole animate entity in a wide, cavernous expanse:</p><p></p><p>The windmills of</p><p>Oklahoma look</p><p>In every direction</p><p></p><p>And, from a 1960 notebook:</p><p></p><p>One flower</p><p>on the cliffside</p><p>Nodding at the canyon</p><p></p><p>That isolated being&#x2014;here &#x201c;look[ing]&#x201d; or &#x201c;nodding&#x201d;&#x2014;is the quintessential Kerouacean persona seen again and again in his Legend of Duluoz.</p><p>Seeking visual possibilities in language, Kerouac combined his spontaneous prose with sketching, a technique suggested to him by Ed White, a friend during his Columbia University days in the late &#x2019;40s: Why don&#x2019;t you sketch in the streets like a painter but with words?</p><p>&#x201c;&#x2018;Keep the eye STEADILY on the object,&#x2019; for haiku,&#x201d; he exhorted himself in his notebooks. &#x201c;WRITE HAIKUS THEN PAINT THE SCENE DESCRIBING THEM!&#x201d; He also likened good haiku to good painting. The best haiku gave him &#x201c;the sensation I get looking at a great painting by Van Gogh, it&#x2019;s there &amp; nothing you can say or do about it, except <i>look</i> in dismay at the power of looking.&#x201d;</p><p>Kerouac also recognized the purposeful caesura or cut of Japanese haiku as key to its sound and sense. Quoting Shakespeare in a 1963 Notebook, Kerouac wrote: &#x201c;birds sit brooding in the snow&#x2019; (combining the thought as well as the sound of the ellipse of a JAP <i>haiku</i>) always wondered where did he get that sound? &amp; always think, that&#x2019;s what I like about S, where he revels in the great world night.&#x201d; The extraordinary juxtapositions often noted in Kerouac&#x2019;s sketched prose&#x2014;in <i>Visions of Cody</i> (written in 1951 and 1952, a portion published in 1959 as <i>Visions of Neal</i>), <i>Doctor Sax</i> (written in July 1952, published in 1959), and &#x201c;October in the Railroad Earth,&#x201d; (1952)&#x2014;especially evoke haiku spirit, even before he was fully immersed in composing haiku.</p></p><h2>Minor Characters: A Beat Memoir</h2><p><b><b>Named one of the 50 best memoirs of the past 50 years by&nbsp;<i>The New York Times</i></b><br><br>Winner of the National Book Critics Circle Award<br><br>&#x201c;Among the great American literary memoirs of the past century . . . a riveting portrait of an era . . . Johnson captures this period with deep clarity and moving insight.&#x201d; &#x2013; Dwight Garner, <i>The New York Times</i></b><br><br>In 1954, Joyce Johnson&#x2019;s Barnard professor told his class that most women could never have the kinds of experiences that would be worth writing about.&nbsp; Attitudes like that were not at all unusual at a time when &#x201c;good&#x201d; women didn&#x2019;t leave home or have sex before they married; even those who broke the rules could merely expect to be minor characters in the dramas played by men. But secret rebels, like Joyce and her classmate Elise Cowen, refused to accept things as they were.<br> &nbsp;<br> As a teenager, Johnson stole down to Greenwich Village to sing folksongs in Washington Square. She was 21 and had started her first novel when Allen Ginsberg introduced her to Jack Kerouac; nine months later she was with Kerouac&nbsp;when the publication of <i>On the Road</i> made him famous overnight. Joyce had longed to go on the road with him; instead she got a front seat at a cultural revolution under attack from all sides; made new friends like Hettie and LeRoi Jones, and found herself fighting to keep the shy, charismatic, tormented Kerouac from destroying himself.&nbsp; It was a woman&#x2019;s adventure and a fast education in life.&nbsp; What Johnson and other Beat Generation women would discover were the risks, the heartache and the heady excitement of trying to live as freely as the rebels they loved.</p><p>National Book Critics Circle Award-winner, <i>Minor Characters</i> has deservedly become known among the cognoscenti as a classic about the 1950s, a vivid and compelling memoir of one woman's coming of age amidst the angels and poets of the Beat Generation. The friend and lover of Jack Kerouac during the two years surrounding the publication of <i>On The Road</i> --the book that made him suddenly and forever famous--Johnson describes with penetrating insight the circle of rebellious visionaries of which she became a part: Allen Ginsberg, Peter Orlovsky, LeRoi Jones, Gregory Corso. But more than just chronicling the drama of her life with a diffident and often drunken Kerouac, Johnson describes the roles that she and the other women in her circle played as companions and acolytes to their male muses, women who set aside their own needs and ambitions, for a time, even as they searched to find their own voices and shape their own lives. As Christopher Lehmann-Haupt wrote in <i>The New York Times</i>, Johnson "has brought to life what history may ultimately judge to have been minor characters, but who were to her own generation major enough to shape its consciousness." Anchor Books is proud to be reissuing <i>Minor Characters</i> with a new introduction by the author that helps to place the Beat Generation in the context of the 1990s.<p></p><p>"Realistic rather than flamboyant, Johnson succeeds in portraying the Beats not as oddities or celebrities but as individuals. In wry retrospect, she recognizes the folly of young women rebelling against their well-meaning parents only to become subservient to indifferent men."--<i>The New Yorker</i> </p><p></p><p>"Johnson writes of Dostoevskian evenings, of Kerouac's disastrous confrontation with fame...of the major Beat voices and the minor characters, their women. It's a terrific book, rich and beautifully written, full of vivid portraits and evocations."--<i>San Francisco Chronicle</i></p><b>Joyce Johnson</b>'s eight books include the 1983 National Book Critics Circle Award winner<i> Minor Characters</i>, the recent memoir <i>Missing Men</i>, the novel <i>In the Night Cafe</i>, and <i>Door Wide Open: A Beat Love Affair in Letters 1957-1958</i> (with Jack Kerouac). She has written for<i> Vanity Fair</i> and <i>The New Yorker</i> and lives in New York City.</p><h2>Aleph Isn&#39;t Enough: Hebrew for Adults (Book 2)</h2><p>Following the success of Aleph Isn&#x2019;t Tough, this book empowers adults to learn Hebrew, focusing on the Hebrew that they use most frequently: that of the siddur, the Haggadah, and the Bible.

Patricia's brother Richard could run the fastest, climb the highest, and spit the farthest and still smile his extra-rotten, greeny-toothed, weasel-eyed grin. But when little Patricia wishes on a shooting star that she could do something&#x2014;<i>anything&#x2014;</i>to show him up, she finds out just what wishes&#x2014;and rotten redheaded older brothers&#x2014;can really do. Patricia Polacco's boldly and exuberantly painted pictures tell a lively and warmhearted tale of comic one-upsmanship and brotherly love.</p><p>Patricia Polacco belongs to a family of storytellers, poets, farmers, teachers, and artists. They came from many parts of the world, but mainly Russia. She grew up to be an illustrator, a designer, and creator of many beloved children&#x2019;s books, including&nbsp;<i>The Keeping Quilt</i>,&nbsp;<i>The Blessing Cup</i>,&nbsp;<i>Fiona&#x2019;s Lace</i>,&nbsp;<i>The Trees of the Dancing Goats</i>,&nbsp;<i>Babushka&#x2019;s Doll</i>, and&nbsp;<i>My Rotten Redheaded Older Brother</i>. She lives in Union City, Michigan. Visit her at PatriciaPolacco.com and follow her on Facebook.PreSchool-Grade 3-Featuring an obnoxious, freckle-faced, bespectacled boy and a comforting, tale-telling grandmother, this autobiographical story is as satisfying as a warm slice of apple pie. Patricia can't quite understand how anyone could possibly like her older brother Richard. Whether picking blackberries or eating raw rhubarb, he always manages to outdo her, rubbing it in with one of his "extra-rotten, weasel-eyed, greeny-toothed grins." When their Bubbie teaches Patricia to wish on a falling star, she knows just what to ask for. The next day her wish comes true; although dizzy, she remains on the carnival merry-go-round longer than Richard. Her nemesis turns into her hero, however, when she takes a spill and he carries her home. This warm-hearted look at a typical family relationship will strike a familiar chord with siblings of all ages. The endless "can so/cannot" arguments and the girl's total exasperation make the dialogue entertaining and realistic. Bubbie's musings are more poetic, adding a sense of wonder to the everyday tone of the text. Polacco's exuberant illustrations, done in marking pens and pencil, are filled with warmth and humor. Pointing angrily at one another or quietly cuddling against Bubbie's heart, the characters are carefully posed to reflect the story's varying moods. Barnyard animals provide an amusing backdrop to the children's antics, puckering their faces at the sour rhubarb and smiling sweetly at a tender moment. Black-and-white photographs of Patricia and Richie at different ages are scattered across the endpapers, adding the final touch to this endearing reminiscence.<br><i> Joy Fleishhacker, New York Public Library</i><br>Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Cunt Coloring Book</h2><p>Over three dozen c**ts of every size and description for you to color.

His love of the outdoors started at a young age, growing up on a farm in the rolling hills of Virginia. Eating wild berries, fishing, and learning about the animals of the forest were all part country life. Tim became interested in survival skills and woodcraft as an offshoot of backpacking as a teen&#x2014;out in remote areas, it seemed like a smart plan to learn some skills. The majority of his training over the years has involved testing survival skills and devising new ones, but the biggest leaps forward occurred as a result of teaching. <br> <br>Tim&#x2019;s teaching experiences over the years have been rich and diverse, from spending hundreds of hours volunteering to founding his own year-round survival school 18 years ago. He has worked with Boy Scouts, youth groups, summer camps, and adults in all walks of life, as well as providing outdoor skills training for numerous personnel in law enforcement, search and rescue organizations, all branches of the United States Armed Forces, the State Department, and the Department of Justice and some of its agencies.

Choose from the following trap types, based on your needs and the animals in your area.<br> &nbsp;<br><b>SNARES </b>You can build primitive snares with materials gathered on-site, even weaving your own string out of bark fibers&#x2014;but many animals will be able to chew through string. Cable snares made from braided steel cable are more secure.<br> &nbsp;<br><b>FOOTHOLD TRAPS </b>Common foothold traps are clamping jaws that grab an animal when it steps on the trigger. They do not kill the prey outright; the trapped animal is usually shot by the trapper.<br> &nbsp;<br><b>BODY&nbsp;GRIP TRAPS </b>Two heavy springs move the trap bars together, snapping the animal&#x2019;s neck, breaking its back, or strangling it. They can be treacherous to set.<br> &nbsp;<br><b>LIVE&nbsp;CATCH TRAPS </b>The typical cage trap is a live-catch trap. This forgiving trap allows you to release animals that you didn&#x2019;t intend to catch and is ideal for urban, suburban, or farm settings.</p><h2>Devi-Mahatmyam (The Chandi)</h2><p>The Devi Mahatmyam is a sacred text used by Hindus for daily chanting to the Divine Mother throughout India, in particular in Bengal....The book is also known as the Chandi or the Duga Saptashati. ...The original text is printed in Devanagri type with English translation, and added footnotes. ...Three aspects of the Divine Mother are depicted in the book : ...Mahakali ...2.

Mr. Farley went on to write thirty-three other enormously popular books about the Black Stallion and other horses which were published in more than twenty countries. He died in 1989, shortly before the publication of his last novel,&nbsp;<i>The Young Black Stallion</i>, written with his son Steven.The gray gelding, Napoleon, was built from the ground up and butter fat. His roundness was not due to overfeeding or lack of exercise but to a most placid disposition and an ease of adapting himself to any kind of situation or way of life. He stood with one hind foot drawn in an easy, relaxed position and eyes half-closed. Only his long ears moved, and they just wobbled as if the weight of them was too much for him to bear at this particular moment. He was the picture of contentment; as peaceful as the June night which enveloped him. There was no reason for him to appear otherwise. He was perfectly happy with his life.<br><br> The grass of his paddock moved in the night breeze, giving it the soft, liquid motion of the sea. There were stars and a moon, and together they shone frostlike on the fences and roofs of the barns and main house a short distance away.<br><br> Finally the old gray roused himself to saunter about his paddock. His movements were slow and quiet. He was very particular in his choice of grass. He would stop only long enough to crop a few mouthfuls, then go on to other grasses that appealed more to his fancy and discriminating taste. But it wasn't long before he returned to his favorite haunt beneath the billowing oak tree. He closed his eyes again.<br><br> All was quiet, and as it should be. The inky silhouette of a tall, black stallion moved in the adjacent paddock to his left. Teeth clicked sharply as the stallion cut the grass low and even.<br><br> The gray's wobbling ears were keen, and by using them he followed the movements of the Black. He was well aware, too, of the whereabouts of the burly black horse in still another paddock, the one on his right. He had heard Satan snort a few moments ago.<br><br> The breeze became stronger, gently whipping his body with a shower of deep evening coolness. After the heat of day it felt very good. That there were no flies to bother him added to his enjoyment. For ideal comfort this was the way it should be. A fly-protected barn during the day, and at night the freedom of the paddocks. For several weeks now the horses had been allowed this privilege. It would continue as long as there was peace in the paddocks. All this the old gray knew very well; his vast experience told him so.<br><br> He knew why he occupied the paddock between the Black and Satan. To keep his head, to think for himself, to do what was expected of him . . . these things he had learned long ago. He did his duties willingly, whether he was on the track, helping to school young and eager yearlings in their first lessons, or here in the paddock, where he was ever watchful of the actions of mature stallions. Knowing that he was wanted, that he had a job to do, gave him a warm consciousness of virtue and well-being. He opened his eyes, took in the paddock fences, and then, as though receiving comfort and security from their great height, permitted his eyelids to drop again. This time he went fast asleep.<br><br> He awakened to the sound of a strong wind. The skies had turned black. The moon was blanketed by heavy, running clouds and the stars were mere pinpoints in the heavens, shedding no light below. The oak tree afforded the gray horse protection against the wind and he was loath to leave it. Besides, there was no reason for him to go. He need only stay here and wait out the wind. If it got worse and became a storm, he was certain that soon he would see the lights go on in the house and barn, and shortly thereafter he and the others would be taken into their stalls. He moved closer to the great trunk of the tree, and for a while just listened to the racing winds above him.<br><br> It was the wind and the blackness of the night that diverted Napoleon's attention from the movements of the tall stallion in the next paddock. For a long while the Black had trotted lightly and warily along the fence, only his eyes disclosing the excitement that burned within him. He made no sound except for the slight, hushed beat of his hoofs over the grass. He did not shrill his challenge to the burly stallion two paddocks away from him. It was not yet time. The Black was clever and able to control the savage instinct that sought release within his great body.<br><br> The wind whipped his mane, and his tail, set high, billowed behind him. He stopped again to measure the height of the fence. In spite of his long limbs he had to stretch his head to touch the top board. He moved on to the front corner of the paddock, facing the barn. Once more he tested his strength against the center boards at this particular spot. They bent as they had before. He pushed harder this time. They cracked and split. He stopped using his strength, waiting almost cunningly until deciding on his next move. The fire in his eyes was mounting.<br><br> Carefully he lowered himself to the ground, pressing the weight of his body against the bottom board. Then he rolled away and struck a smashing blow against it with his hind feet. It split as had the others. Still on his back, he rolled back and forth, using his great body like a pendulum against the boards. But he did not ram his weight like a blundering bruiser. Instead, with cunning and skill he maneuvered his body, using pressure against the split boards only when he knew they were most apt to give completely. Finally they broke and were swept outward as he rolled under the top board. The Black was free of his confining paddock!</p><h2>Nonviolence: The History of a Dangerous Idea (Modern Library Chronicles)</h2><p>In this timely, highly original, and controversial narrative, <i>New York Times </i>bestselling author Mark Kurlansky discusses nonviolence as a distinct entity, a course of action, rather than a mere state of mind. Nonviolence can and should be a technique for overcoming social injustice and ending wars, he asserts, which is why it is the preferred method of those who speak truth to power. <br><br><i>Nonviolence</i> is a sweeping yet concise history that moves from ancient Hindu times to present-day conflicts raging in the Middle East and elsewhere. Kurlansky also brings into focus just why nonviolence is a &#x201c;dangerous&#x201d; idea, and asks such provocative questions as: Is there such a thing as a &#x201c;just war&#x201d;? Could nonviolence have worked against even the most evil regimes in history?<br><br>Kurlansky draws from history twenty-five provocative lessons on the subject that we can use to effect change today. He shows how, time and again, violence is used to suppress nonviolence and its practitioners&#x2013;Gandhi and Martin Luther King, for example; that the stated deterrence value of standing national armies and huge weapons arsenals is, at best, negligible; and, encouragingly, that much of the hard work necessary to begin a movement to end war is already complete. It simply needs to be embraced and accelerated.<br><br>Engaging, scholarly, and brilliantly reasoned, <i>Nonviolence</i> is a work that compels readers to look at history in an entirely new way. This is not just a manifesto for our times but a trailblazing book whose time has come.</p><p>Mark Kurlansky is the <i>New York Times </i>bestselling and James A. Beard Award&#x2014;winning author of <i>Cod: A Biography of the Fish That Changed the World</i>; <i>Salt: A World History; 1968: The Year That Rocked the World; The Basque History of the World; </i>and <i>The Big Oyster: History on the Half Shell</i>; as well as the novel <i>Boogaloo on 2nd Avenue </i>and several other books.

The concept has been praised by every major religion. Throughout history there have been practitioners of nonviolence. Yet, while every major language has a word for violence, there is no word to express the idea of nonviolence except that it is not another idea, it is not violence. In Sanskrit, the word for violence is himsa, harm, and the negation of himsa, just as nonviolence is the negation of violence, is ahimsa&#x2014;not doing harm. But if ahimsa is &#x201c;not doing harm,&#x201d; what is it doing?<br><br> The only possible explanation for the absence of a proactive word to express nonviolence is that not only the political establishments but the cultural and intellectual establishments of all societies have viewed nonviolence as a marginal point of view, a fanciful rejection of one of society&#x2019;s key components, a repudiation of something important but not a serious force in itself. It is not an authentic concept but simply the abnegation of something else. It has been marginalized because it is one of the rare truly revolutionary ideas, an idea that seeks to completely change the nature of society, a threat to the established order. And it has always been treated as something profoundly dangerous.<br><br> Advocates of nonviolence&#x2014;dangerous people&#x2014;have been there throughout history, questioning the greatness of Caesar and Napo- leon and the Founding Fathers and Roosevelt and Churchill. For every Crusade and Revolution and Civil War there have always been those who argued, with great clarity, that violence not only was immoral but that it was even a less effective means of achieving laudable goals. The case can be made that it was not the American Revolution that secured independence from Britain; it was not the Civil War that freed the slaves; and World War II did not save the Jews. But this possibility has rarely been considered, because the Caesars and Napoleons of history have always used their power to muffle the voices of those who would challenge the necessity of war&#x2014;and it is these Caesars, as Napoleon observed, who get to write history. And so the ones who have killed become the ones who are revered. But there is another history that manages to survive.<br><br> It survives, but nonviolence is in fact a marginal rejection of a marginalized concept. Political theorist Hannah Arendt, in her 1969 study On Violence, pointed out that while it can be universally agreed that violence has been one of the primary movers of history, historians and social scientists rarely study the subject of violence. She suggested that this was because violence was such a mainstay of human activity that it was &#x201c;taken for granted and therefore neglected.&#x201d; Violence is a fundamental of the human condition, whereas nonviolence is merely a rarified response to that reality. What does this mean? If we lived in a world that had no word for war other than nonpeace, what kind of world would that be? It would not necessarily be a world without war, but it would be a world that regarded war as an aberrant and insignificant activity. The widely held and seldom expressed but implicit viewpoint of most cultures is that violence is real and nonviolence is unreal. But when nonviolence becomes a reality it is a powerful force.<br><br> Nonviolence is not the same thing as pacifism, for which there are many words. Pacifism is treated almost as a psychological condition. It is a state of mind. Pacifism is passive; but nonviolence is active. Pacifism is harmless and therefore easier to accept than nonviolence, which is dangerous. When Jesus Christ said that a victim should turn the other cheek, he was preaching pacifism. But when he said that an enemy should be won over through the power of love, he was preaching nonviolence. Nonviolence, exactly like violence, is a means of persuasion, a technique for political activism, a recipe for prevailing. It requires a great deal more imagination to devise nonviolent means&#x2014;boycotts, sit-ins, strikes, street theater, demonstrations&#x2014;than to use force. And there is not always agreement on what constitutes violence. Some advocates of nonviolence believe that boycotts and embargoes that cause hunger and deprivation are a form of violence. Some believe that using less lethal means of force, rock throwing or rubber bullets, is a form of nonvio- lence. But the central belief is that forms of persuasion that do not use physical force, do not cause suffering, are more effective; and while there is often a moral argument for nonviolence, the core of the belief is political: that nonviolence is more effective than violence, that violence does not work.<br><br> Mohandas Gandhi invented a word for it, satyagraha, from satya, meaning truth. Satyagraha, according to Gandhi, literally means &#x201c;holding on to truth&#x201d; or &#x201c;truth force.&#x201d; Interestingly, although Gandhi&#x2019;s teachings and techniques have had a huge impact on political activists around the world, his word for it, satyagraha, has never caught on.<br><br> All religions discuss the power of nonviolence and the evil of violence. Hinduism, which claims to be the oldest religion, though its founding date is unknown, as is its founder, does not take a clear stand on nonviolence. This ambiguity is not surprising for an ancient religion that has no central belief or official priests and has a plethora of scriptures, gods, mythologies, and cults. Hindus often repeat the aphorism &#x201c;Ahimsa paramo dharmah,&#x201d; nonviolence is the highest law, but this is not an unshakable principle of the religion. Violence is permissible in the Hindu religion, and Indra is a warlike Hindu god. But there are also many writings of Hindu wise men against violence, especially in a book known as the Mahabharata. Hindu sages tended to see nonviolence as an unattainable ideal. Perfect nonviolence would mean not harming any living thing. The sages encouraged vegetarianism to avoid harming animals. The Jainists, followers of a religion admired by Gandhi, keep their mouths masked to insure that they do not accidentally inhale a tiny insect. But Hinduism recognizes that even the strictest vegetarians harm plants, killing them in order to live. A saint, it is said, would live on air, but Hinduism recognizes that this is impossible. Complete ahimsa is not attainable. Gandhi wrote, &#x201c;Nonviolence is a perfect stage. It is a goal towards which all mankind moves naturally, though unconsciously.&#x201d; He believed human beings were working toward perfection. Violence was a barbaric retrogressive trait that had not yet been shed. The human being who achieved complete nonviolence, according to Gandhi, would not be a saint. &#x201c;He only becomes truly a man,&#x201d; he said.<br><br> This concept of man as an imperfect being who is obligated to strive for an unattainable perfection runs through most of human thought. The nineteenth-century French founder of the anarchist movement, Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, wrote in his 1853 Philosophie du progr�s, &#x201c;We are born perfectable, but we shall never be per- fect.&#x201d; The often repeated argument against nonviolence, that it is in our nature to be violent&#x2014;no doubt why violence deserves its own word&#x2014;lacks validity in light of the ubiquitous moral argument that it is our obligation to try to be better than we are.<br><br> Hinduism and Gandhi insist that nonviolence must never come from weakness but from strength, and only the strongest and most disciplined people can hope to achieve it. Those who are incapable of defending themselves without violence, those who lack the spiri- tual strength to match their adversary&#x2019;s physical brutality, either because of their own weakness or the determined brutality of the enemy, are obligated to use physical violence for defense. In Hinduism, passive submission to brutality is usually considered a sin.<br><br> Whenever the Chinese denounce the pacifist tendencies in their culture, they usually blame these tendencies on Buddhism. This is because Buddhism is the only important Eastern religion in China that is of foreign origin. Buddha, the sixth-century b.c. founder, was born near the Indian-Nepalese border. If pacifism is a national weakness, many Chinese have contended, surely it is the fault of foreigners. And so Hu Shi, the Columbia University&#x2013;educated Chinese scholar (1891&#x2013;1962), said, &#x201c;Buddhism, which dominated Chinese religious life for twenty centuries, has reinforced the peaceful tendencies of an already too peaceful people.&#x201d; His implication was that the rejection of violence makes people passive, and many early-twentieth-century Chinese believed their people had become too passive. This ignored the fact that most religions and philosophies that reject violence do not encourage passiveness but activism by other means&#x2014;nonviolence.<br><br> Buddhism forbids the taking of life, but there seems to be a wide range of interpretations of this stance. In some countries it means vegetarianism, but in Tibet, perhaps because of a lack of vegetables, it means that animals must be slaughtered &#x201c;humanely.&#x201d; To a Tibetan Buddhist, however, this means the opposite of what it means to a Jew. To Jews, humane slaughter is the clean slitting of the animal&#x2019;s throat and the removal of all blood, whereas in Tibet it means death by suffocation, to avoid the spilling of blood.<br><br> While the Buddhist interdiction on taking life was frequently interpreted in China as a condemnation of militarism, this was not the case in medieval Japan. In Japan Buddhism developed the &#x201c;medi- tation school&#x201d; commonly known as Zen. In the Middle Ages, Zen monks became warriors and monasteries became military fortresses. The original idea of Zen was the suppression of the body in order to reach a higher level of meditation. In the fourteenth century the technique was applied not only to meditation but to swordsmanship and archery. Three centuries later, Zen had become an integral part of the warrior code in Japan. This was neither the first nor last incident of a religion being perverted for military purposes.<br><br> In Buddhism, as in Hinduism, there is the notion of humans reaching higher levels, and one of the ways this is accomplished is by rendering aid to all beings. But Buddhism is not the only source of nonviolent thinking in China. The position on war and nonviolence in Confucianism, a belief system developed in China from 722 to 484 b.c., is even more vague than in Hinduism. It is not even clear that Confucianism is a religion. Many prefer to describe it as a moral philosophy. Nor is there agreement on the extent of the role of Confucius, whose real name was Kong Fuzi, a contempo-rary of Buddha, who lived between 551 and 479 b.c. The Analects, a compilation of Confucius&#x2019;s sayings that was assembled long after his death, defined the function of government as providing food and troops and earning the people&#x2019;s confidence. Asked which could be suspended in hard times, he answered, &#x201c;Dispense with the troops.&#x201d; This idea that military is essential to government but less essential than other functions runs throughout The Analects.<br><br> Confucius was not a pacifist, nor did he teach the power of nonviolence. But The Analects also at times rejects the notion of state violence, saying, &#x201c;If good men were to administer the government for a hundred years, violence could be overcome and capital punishment dispensed with.&#x201d; And when the question comes up of how to deal with neighboring barbarians, the standard rationale for military campaigns in China, the reply in The Analects is: &#x201c;If the distant peoples do not submit, then build up culture and character and so win them, and when they have been won give them security.&#x201d; It is a succinct statement of the nonviolent approach to political activism.<br><br> But the strongest Chinese stand on nonviolence came in opposition to Confucius, from a man named Mozi, who lived from about 470 to 390 b.c. Mozi frequently attacked Confucianists for being aristocrats, which has led some scholars to conclude that he came from a class of slaves. But like other rebels, including Jesus and Gandhi, he may have chosen to throw in with the poorest class as a protest against their unfair treatment. While Confucius was a voice of the establishment, Mozi was a rebel. While Confucius envisioned a hierarchy of love in which the greatest affection was given to family, Mozi called for universal love, chien ai, and emphasized helping the poor. <br><br> Mozi described the concept of chien ai: &#x201c;He throws me a peach, I return him a plum.&#x201d; Mozi saw this concept of mutual love, chien ai, as the key to righting the world&#x2019;s ills.</p><h2>In Praise of Paths: Walking through Time and Nature</h2><p><p><strong>An ode to paths and the journeys we take through nature, as told by a gifted writer who stopped driving and rediscovered the joys of traveling by foot.&nbsp;</strong></p> <p>Torbj�rn Ekelund started to walk&#x2015;everywhere&#x2015;after an epilepsy diagnosis affected his ability to drive.

She lives in Rochester, New York.One<br><br>Tricia Miles almost always felt a thrill to host a book signing at her mystery bookstore, Haven't Got a Clue, especially when it involved a favorite author. Tonight that author was Steven Richardson, known for writing <i>New York Times </i>and <i>USA Today</i> bestselling thrillers. Stacks of his latest hardcover, <i>A Killing in Mad Gate</i>, sat on a table at the front of the store. The weather was perfect for a signing: drizzling and gray. Now all she needed was for the guest of honor to arrive.<br><br> Tricia's assistant, Pixie Poe, checked the big pink watch on her left wrist. "He's late," she sang. To honor the author, Pixie had chosen a fuchsia floral dress that had been made at least six decades before, and, despite her rather chunky frame, the dress not only fit as though it had been made for her, but was actually quite flattering, giving her an hourglass figure that she seemed to enjoy flaunting.<br><br> This month, she was again a blonde, and when she smiled, her gold canine tooth flashed. She'd been smiling a lot that evening&#x2014;every time she glanced at the modest diamond solitaire on her left hand. Her newly minted fianc�, Fred Pillins, was a nondescript kind of fellow who matched Pixie in years&#x2014;about fifty. He stood near the back of the store, camera in hand, trying to look inconspicuous&#x2014;except that his fond gaze rarely strayed from Pixie. He seemed to enjoy the view. He must have taken at least a dozen candid shots of her since his arrival some twenty minutes before. That was when the signing was supposed to have begun.<br><br> In addition to the Tuesday Night Book Club members, nearly two dozen of Tricia's customers from a fifty-mile radius had shown up to welcome the author. Tricia was glad she'd not only ordered a cake with the book's cover printed in edible ink from the Patisserie but a big plate of assorted cookies to go along with the sparkling punch she'd made from her sister Angelica's recipe.<br><br> Angelica approached, looking stupendous in a tailored ivory suit with matching stilettos, holding a paper cup filled with punch. "Your author <i>was</i> aware of the time of the signing, wasn't he?"<br><br> Tricia sighed. "Yes. But he was driving up from Boston. Thanks to the rain, who knows what the traffic is like. I'm sure he'll be here soon-and if not, I hope he'll at least call me." Tricia squinted at her sister. "Remind me again why <i>you're</i> here?"<br><br> "<i>Moi</i>?" Angelica practically cooed.<br><br> "<i>Oui, tu</i>. You're not exactly a thriller reader."<br><br> Angelica sighed patiently. "I want to see if there are sparks!"<br><br> "Sparks?"<br><br> "Yes, between you and Steven."<br><br> Tricia eyed her sister coolly.<br><br> "He kissed you on the <i>Celtic Lady </i>cruise."<br><br> Tricia frowned. "I have kissed three men since then."<br><br> "Daddy, Antonio, and Mr. Everett don't count," Angelica said, citing her stepson and Tricia's elderly employee and friend.<br><br> "There will be <i>no </i>sparks."<br><br> "She said in denial," Angelica muttered.<br><br> Tricia's frown deepened to a glare. "Instead of sparks, you might see my temper explode."<br><br> Angelica shook her head. "It's never going to happen, my dear sister. You don't <i>have</i> a temper."<br><br> "I'll consider getting one."<br><br> The bookstore's door opened, the little bell overhead tinkling cheerfully, but it was not Richardson who entered. Instead, it was someone well known to Tricia and Angelica.<br><br> "Oh, dear," Angelica muttered, taking in the man dressed in an outrageous&#x2014;for him&#x2014;pink aloha shirt and holding a big black umbrella with a couple of broken ribs. Again, Tricia sighed and, despite a pang of dread, forced a smile. It had been five all-too-very-short months since she'd last seen her father, John Miles.<br><br> "Daddy! Whatever are you doing back in Stoneham?"<br><br> John struggled to close the soaked bumbershoot. "I came to visit my two best girls, of course."<br><br> Angelica's smile was even more rigid. "What a pleasure."<br><br> It wasn't.<br><br> Still, once he'd closed the umbrella, the sisters leaned in to give John a kiss on each cheek.<br><br> To say John had outstayed his welcome back in January was an understatement. Not only had he left the village owing money to nearly half the Chamber of Commerce's members&#x2014;which Angelica had had to reimburse&#x2014;but he'd left the Sheer Comfort Inn without notice and apparently with his suitcases filled with a number of the antiques that had decorated the place. Their father's deadbeat behavior had not only been unexpected&#x2014;but unprecedented. That he'd left with no explanation was just as surprising.<br><br> Before the sisters could ask even the most basic of questions&#x2014;like <i>"When are you leaving?"&#x2014;</i>the bell over the door tinkled once again, this time admitting the long-awaited author, looking decidedly damp around the edges.<br><br> "Tricia!" Richardson called. He sounded winded.<br><br> "Steven&#x2014;at last!" Tricia excused herself, leaving Angelica to deal with their father. She joined the author. "Are you okay? I was getting worried."<br><br> "I just ran from the municipal parking lot. Sorry I'm so late. The traffic outside of Boston was abominable, and then there was a wreck near Nashua that backed everything up for miles."<br><br> "I figured as much."<br><br> "Do you still want me to give a reading?"<br><br> "I think your fans would be disappointed if you didn't speak&#x2014;but if you'd prefer to do a Q and A instead, I don't think anyone would object."<br><br> He nodded and pointed toward the table piled with his latest novel. "Shall I?"<br><br> "Yes, please," Tricia said, and gestured for him to stand beside it. She joined him to face her customers, who were mostly talking among themselves and scarfing down cookies and punch. "May I have your attention!" she called, but without much impact. "Excuse me; we're ready to start!" Her efforts weren't attracting much attention.<br><br> Pixie moved to stand beside her. "I'll take care of this." She raised her right thumb and index finger to her lips and let loose with a shrill whistle that was as effective as nails on a chalkboard for silencing the room. Tricia winced as everyone turned in attention, while Pixie studied her hand. "Damn. Now I've got to go freshen my lipstick."<br><br> Tricia plastered on a smile. "Ladies and gentlemen, won't you please take your seats? It's my pleasure to present a man whose books are well known, and loved, by all of us here tonight&#x2014;"<br><br> "Not me," muttered a female voice from somewhere in the store, but Tricia had no clue who said it.<br><br> Momentarily rattled, she launched back into her introduction. "Author Steven Richardson."<br><br> A smattering of applause followed, and then there seemed to be a mad dash as everyone sought a seat at the front of the room, which had been rearranged so that the comfortable upholstered chairs of the reading nook faced the front of the store, with metal folding chairs set up in rows behind them.<br><br> It took another minute or two for the murmur of voices to quiet, then Richardson spoke.<br><br> "It's great to see such a welcoming crowd here at Haven't Got a Clue. Before I tell you about my latest book, <i>A Killing in Mad Gate</i>, I'd like to tell you a little about myself."<br><br> "Don't bother," came the same rude voice. Tricia searched the faces of the women that populated the small audience, but still wasn't sure who'd spoken. It definitely wasn't Grace Harris-Everett, who sat primly next to her husband, Mr. Everett, nor could it have been Mary Fairchild, her neighbor and owner of the By Hook or By Book craft store. Tricia wasn't as familiar with the rest of the ladies.<br><br> She circled back to the table that held the goodies, where Angelica was again ladling punch into her cup. "This really is good!" she whispered.<br><br> "Who's being rude to Steven?" Tricia asked.<br><br> Angelica took a sip. "No idea. Why would someone come to a signing if they didn't like the author?"<br><br> "I just hope there isn't going to be any unpleasantness."<br><br> John had ditched his soggy umbrella, and he sidled up to the table, grabbing a napkin and taking a couple of the cookies. "We should probably talk," he said, and popped one of the butter cookies into his mouth, chewing. He jerked a thumb in the direction of the back of the store.<br><br> Tricia wasn't sure she wanted to engage in conversation with her not-so-dear old dad. It was nearly seven thirty. Was he about to beg for a bed to stay the night? Luckily, she wasn't in a position to offer him one&#x2014;thanks to the state of her home, which had been torn apart for the renovation of the second and third floors of the building she now owned, as evidenced by dust that had accumulated on the baseboards and had escaped Mr. Everett's lamb's wool duster. Unbeknownst to most of the village of Stoneham, Angelica owned not only the Sheer Comfort Inn, but the Brookview Inn. After he'd pulled a disappearing act, Tricia was pretty sure her sister wouldn't be issuing an invitation for their father to stay in either location. Angelica had been pretty steamed to have to not only clean up after him but come up with a reasonable explanation for his boorish behavior.<br><br> Still, he <i>was</i> their father.<br><br> The sisters followed John to the back of the shop.<br><br> "Daddy," Angelica began, and Tricia recognized that no-nonsense tone. "You left rather suddenly back in January, with many unpaid bills."<br><br> Instead of looking embarrassed, John actually grinned. "Now, that's not quite right&#x2014;"<br><br> "Yes, it's definitely right," Angelica insisted, keeping her voice low. "I know, because I had to come up with excuses for many of the merchants in the village as to why you disappeared without a trace. You didn't even let Tricia and me know you were leaving the area."<br><br> "I was offered a wonderful business proposition&#x2014;but it was time dependent, and I simply had to leave. But now I'm back and prepared to make restitution."<br><br> "<i>Full</i> restitution?" Angelica asked.<br><br> "Of course. Although there seems to be a little resentment from some of the local merchants. They said they had no rooms at both the Sheer Comfort Inn <i>and</i> the Brookview Inn, and yet the parking lots for both establishments were nearly empty."<br><br> Tricia knew Angelica had provided the staffs of both properties with a picture of John Miles and a warning to them <i>not</i> to give him a room should he ever show up again.<br><br> "Would I be able to stay with either of you?" John asked.<br><br> Tricia shook her head sadly. "My loft is undergoing a massive renovation. I'm not even staying here right now."<br><br> "Really?" John asked, sounding skeptical. "And yet I see no trace of work being done."<br><br> Tricia wasn't about to point out the dust. Instead, she jerked a thumb over her shoulder. "There's a twenty-yard Dumpster behind the building, just through that door."<br><br> John turned to Angelica. "I have a one-bedroom loft."<br><br> "I'd be perfectly willing to sleep on the couch."<br><br> "I'm sorry, Daddy, but it's out being upholstered," Angelica lied without batting an eye.<br><br> John's jovial features began to sag. "Where am I to stay? I have no other friends or relatives in the area."<br><br> "Why aren't you with Mother?" Angelica asked, rather pointedly.<br><br> "Ah, I hate to be the bearer of unhappy news, but . . . your mother and I have separated."<br><br> Tricia gave her sister a sidelong glance. This really wasn't surprising news. Not that either of them had heard a word about it from their mother after their ill-fated visit to Bermuda to see her five months before.<br><br> "Has she gone back to Rio?" Tricia asked.<br><br> "Uh, initially yes. As you know, things aren't quite as nice as they once were in Brazil. When we last spoke, she told me she had packed up and was moving back to Connecticut."<br><br> "When was this?" Angelica asked.<br><br> "About a month ago."<br><br> "And where were you at the time?" Tricia asked.<br><br> "In Las Vegas." John's good-humored smile had returned once more.<br><br> "Gambling?" Angelica guessed.<br><br> "Just for fun," John admitted. "Unfortunately, the business deal I spoke of only moments ago fell through."<br><br> "And that's why you're back here?" Tricia guessed.<br><br> "Er, yes. A man can always depend on his loving children in a time of crisis."<br><br> "What's the crisis?" Angelica asked, none too kindly. "You said you came back to make full restitution to the area merchants."<br><br> "Well, yes&#x2014;"<br><br> "It's not a health scare, is it?" Tricia asked, and this time she was concerned.<br><br> "Oh, nothing of the sort."<br><br> "That's good," Angelica said, but her gaze was still sharp.<br><br> "Why don't we go over to the Dog-Eared Page and get a drink and talk things over," John suggested.<br><br> Tricia nodded toward the front of her store, where the author talk was still in full swing. "I've got a business to run."<br><br> "And I'm helping her," Angelica said.<br><br> Actually, Pixie was helping Tricia run the event, but she didn't contradict her sibling.<br><br> "I could go over and wait for you both, but there's a tiny problem. The proprietress doesn't seem to want to serve me."<br><br> So, his first stop after being refused accommodations <i>hadn't </i>been to seek out his darling daughters.<br><br> "That's because you left the village with a very large tab," Angelica said.<br><br> "What's a few dollars?" John said, shrugging.<br><br> "A few<i> thousand </i>dollars," Angelica corrected him. "Surely you didn't think the people you owed money to wouldn't come asking Tricia and me about your whereabouts and expecting to be paid."<br><br> "It's all a big misunderstanding," John insisted.<br><br> "I'm listening," Angelica insisted.<br><br> But before John could explain, the group of people at the front of the shop broke into enthusiastic applause.<br><br> "I've got to get back to work," Tricia said. "If you'll excuse me."<br><br> "And I've got to help her," Angelica insisted, and followed in her sister's wake.<br><br> By the time Tricia made it to the middle of the shop, Richardson had already taken his seat at the book table with pen in hand, while Pixie readied the books, handing them to him open at the title page, ready for him to sign.<br><br> "I'll take care of the cake," Angelica said, and marched around the goodies table. "Do you want me to wait until Steven has his picture taken with it before I cut it?"<br><br> "Let's not bother." The hands on the clock were already marching toward eight. "I'd better go man the register." Tricia turned, but Mr. Everett was already stationed behind the sales desk, waiting for the first customer.<br><br> She hurried over to him. "Oh, Mr. Everett, it's your night off. I'll take care of the sales."<br><br> "I saw that you were engaged, Ms. Miles, and I thought it best to cover all bases."<br><br> "You're a dear. Angelica's about to cut the cake. Why don't you get a slice for yourself and Grace?"<br><br> "I will, thank you."<br><br> Tricia watched her friend stroll over to the goodies table, but saw that her father was already there&#x2014;stuffing his pockets full of cookies and speaking to one of the store's customers&#x2014;Carol Talbot. The fifty-something woman's heavily lined features no doubt were the result of years of heavy tanning and reminded Tricia of an angry bulldog, which matched her personality. It was her body that was the envy of women decades younger. This evening she'd dressed in a form-fitting pink floral sundress with a bolero jacket, accented by a string of faux pearls around her neck. A cutthroat darts player, Carol had often played against Tricia on tournament nights at the Dog-Eared Page. Carol wasn't one of Tricia's favorite people, nor a regular customer, so it was surprising she had made the effort to attend the signing.</p><h2>Called by the Gospel: An Introduction to the New Testament</h2><p>Called by the Gospel is the title for a series of introductory theological textbooks written from a distinctly Lutheran perspective. In keeping with the predominant place of the gospel in Lutheran theology, this introductory volume on the New Testament carries the same title as the series, Called by the Gospel. Readers will find within its pages a high view of the Christian Scriptures, explanation of keys texts with careful attention to the historical and cultural contexts, particular focus on the presentation of Jesus by the various texts, and a conversational style that seeks to convey the message of the text for contemporary times. Although the book was written with university students in mind, any Christians who seek to deepen their grasp of the New Testament will find within its pages helpful and challenging insights. This book builds on material presented in the first volume of the series, Called to be God&#39;s People, and supplements its contents with maps, photos, suggested readings, discussion questions, and a glossary. Together these two volumes prepare the university student for an in-depth consideration of Christian doctrine in Called to Believe, Teach, and Confess.</p><p>Michael P.

French and German intelligence operatives are locked in a life-and-death struggle on the espionage battlefield. At the French embassy, in Warsaw, the new military attach�, Colonel Jean-Fran�ois Mercier, a decorated hero of the 1914 war, is drawn into a world of abduction, betrayal, and intrigue in the diplomatic salons and back alleys of the city. At the same time, the handsome aristocrat finds himself in a passionate love affair with a Parisian woman of Polish heritage, a lawyer for the League of Nations. Risking his life, Colonel Mercier must work in the shadows, amid an extraordinary cast of venal characters, some known to Mercier as spies, some never to be revealed.</p><p>Alan Furst is widely recognized as the master of the historical spy novel.

Above the city, the sky was at war; the last of the sun struck blood-red embers off massed black cloud, while the clear horizon to the west was the color of blue ice. Herr Uhl suppressed a shiver; the sharp air of the evening, he told himself. But this was Poland, the border of the Russian steppe, and what had reached him was well beyond the chill of an October twilight.<br><br>A taxi waited on Jerozolimskie street, in front of the station. The driver, an old man with a seamed face, sat patiently, knotted hands at rest on the steering wheel. "Hotel Europejski," Uhl told the driver. He wanted to add, and be quick about it, but the words would have been in German, and it was not so good to speak German in this city. Germany had absorbed the western part of Poland in 1795-Russia ruled the east, Austria-Hungary the southwest corner-for a hundred and twenty-three years, a period the Poles called "the Partition," a time of national conspiracy and defeated insurrection, leaving ample bad blood on all sides. With the rebirth of Poland in 1918, the new borders left a million Germans in Poland and two million Poles in Germany, which guaranteed that the bad blood would stay bad. So, for a German visiting Warsaw, a current of silent hostility, closed faces, small slights: we don't want you here.<br><br>Nonetheless, Edvard Uhl had looked forward to this trip for weeks. In his late forties, he combed what remained of his hair in strands across his scalp and cultivated a heavy dark mustache, meant to deflect attention from a prominent bulbous nose, the bulb divided at the tip. A feature one saw in Poland, often enough. So, an ordinary- looking man, who led a rather ordinary life, a more-than-decent life, in the small city of Breslau: a wife and three children, a good job- as a senior engineer at an ironworks and foundry, a subcontractor to the giant Rheinmetall firm in D�sseldorf-a few friends, memberships in a church and a singing society. Oh, maybe the political situation- that wretched Hitler and his wretched Nazis strutting about-could have been better, but one abided, lived quietly, kept one's opinions to oneself; it wasn't so difficult. And the paycheck came every week. What more could a man want?<br><br>Instinctively, his hand made sure of the leather satchel on the seat by his side. A tiny stab of regret touched his heart. Foolish, Edvard, truly it is. For the satchel, a gift from his first contact at the French embassy in Warsaw, had a false bottom, beneath which lay a sheaf of engineering diagrams. Well, he thought, one did what one had to do, so life went. No, one did what one had to do in order to do what one wanted to do-so life really went. He wasn't supposed to be in Warsaw; he was supposed, by his family and his employer, to be in Gleiwitz-just on the German side of the frontier dividing German Lower Silesia from Polish Upper Silesia-where his firm employed a large metal shop for the work that exceeded their capacity in Breslau. With the Reich rearming, they could not keep up with the orders that flowed from the Wehrmacht. The Gleiwitz works functioned well enough, but that wasn't what Uhl told his bosses. "A bunch of lazy idiots down there," he said, with a grim shake of the head, and found it necessary to take the train down to Gleiwitz once a month to straighten things out.<br><br>And he did go to Gleiwitz-that pest from Breslau, back again!-but he didn't stay there. When he was done bothering the local management he took the train up to Warsaw where, in a manner of speaking, one very particular thing got straightened out. For Uhl, a blissful night of lovemaking, followed by a brief meeting at dawn, a secret meeting, then back to Breslau, back to Frau Uhl and his more-than-decent life. Refreshed. Reborn. Too much, that word? No. Just right.<br><br>Uhl glanced at his watch. Drive faster, you peasant! This is an automobile, not a plow. The taxi crawled along Nowy Swiat, the grand avenue of Warsaw, deserted at this hour-the Poles went home for dinner at four. As the taxi passed a church, the driver slowed for a moment, then lifted his cap. It was not especially reverent, Uhl thought, simply something the man did every time he passed a church.<br><br>At last, the imposing Hotel Europejski, with its giant of a doorman in visored cap and uniform worthy of a Napoleonic marshal. Uhl handed the driver his fare-he kept a reserve of Polish zloty in his desk at the office-and added a small, proper gratuity, then said "Dankesch�n." It didn't matter now, he was where he wanted to be. In the room, he hung up his suit, shirt, and tie, laid out fresh socks and underwear on the bed, and went into the bathroom to have a thorough wash. He had just enough time; the Countess Sczelenska would arrive in thirty minutes. Or, rather, that was the time set for the rendezvous; she would of course be late, would make him wait for her, let him think, let him anticipate, let him steam.<br><br>And was she a countess? A real Polish countess? Probably not, he thought. But so she called herself, and she was, to him, like a countess: imperious, haughty, and demanding. Oh how this provoked him, as the evening lengthened and they drank champagne, as her mood slid, subtly, from courteous disdain to sly submission, then on to breathless urgency. It was the same always, their private melodrama, with an ending that never changed. Uhl the stallion-despite the image in the mirrored armoire, a middle-aged gentleman with thin legs and potbelly and pale chest home to a few wisps of hair-demonstrably excited as he knelt on the hotel carpet, while the countess, looking down at him over her shoulder, eyebrows raised in mock surprise, deigned to let him roll her silk underpants down her great, saucy, fat bottom. Noblesse oblige. You may have your little pleasure, she seemed to say, if you are so inspired by what the noble Sczelenska bloodline has wrought. Uhl would embrace her middle and honor the noble heritage with tender kisses. In time very effective, such honor, and she would raise him up, eager for what came next.<br><br>He'd met her a year and a half earlier, in Breslau, at a Weinstube where the office employees of the foundry would stop for a little something after work. The Weinstube had a small terrace in back, three tables and a vine, and there she sat, alone at one of the tables on the deserted terrace: morose and preoccupied. He'd sat at the next table, found her attractive-not young, not old, on the buxom side, with brassy hair pinned up high and an appealing face-and said good evening. And why so glum, on such a pleasant night?<br><br>She'd come down from Warsaw, she explained, to see her sister, a family crisis, a catastrophe. The family had owned, for several generations, a small but profitable lumber mill in the forest along the eastern border. But they had suffered financial reverses, and then the storage sheds had been burned down by a Ukrainian nationalist gang, and they'd had to borrow money from a Jewish speculator. But the problems wouldn't stop, they could not repay the loans, and now that dreadful man had gone to court and taken the mill. Just like them, wasn't it.<br><br>After a few minutes, Uhl moved to her table. Well, that was life for you, he'd said. Fate turned evil, often for those who least deserved it. But, don't feel so bad, luck had gone wrong, but it could go right, it always did, given time. Ah but he was sympathique, she'd said, an aristocratic reflex to use the French word in the midst of her fluent German. They went on for a while, back and forth. Perhaps some day, she'd said, if he should find himself in Warsaw, he might telephone; there was the loveliest caf� near her apartment. Perhaps he would, yes, business took him to Warsaw now and again; he guessed he might be there soon. Now, would she permit him to order another glass of wine? Later, she took his hand beneath the table and he was, by the time they parted, on fire.<br><br>Ten days later, from a public telephone at the Breslau railway station, he'd called her. He planned to be in Warsaw next week, at the Europejski, would she care to join him for dinner? Why yes, yes she would. Her tone of voice, on the other end of the line, told him all he needed to know, and by the following Wednesday-those idiots in Gleiwitz had done it again!-he was on his way to Warsaw. At dinner, champagne and langoustines, he suggested that they go on to a nightclub after dessert, but first he wanted to visit the room, to change his tie.<br><br>And so, after the cream cake, up they went.<br><br>For two subsequent, monthly, visits, all was paradise, but, it turned out, she was the unluckiest of countesses. In his room at the hotel, brassy hair tumbled on the pillow, she told him of her latest misfortune. Now it was her landlord, a hulking beast who leered at her, made chk-chk noises with his mouth when she climbed the stairs, who'd told her that she had to leave, his latest girlfriend to be installed in her place. Unless . . . Her misty eyes told him the rest.<br><br>Never! Where Uhl had just been, this swine would not go! He stroked her shoulder, damp from recent exertions, and said, "Now, now, my dearest, calm yourself." She would just have to find another apartment. Well, in fact she'd already done that, found one even nicer than the one she had now, and very private, owned by a man in Cracow, so nobody would be watching her if, for example, her sweet Edvard wanted to come for a visit. But the rent was two hundred zloty more than she paid now. And she didn't have it.<br><br>A hundred reichsmark, he thought. "Perhaps I can help," he said. And he could, but not for long. Two months, maybe three-beyond that, there really weren't any corners he could cut. He tried to save a little, but almost all of his salary went to support his family. Still, he couldn't get the "hulking beast" out of his mind. Chk-chk.<br><br>The blow fell a month later, the man in Cracow had to raise the rent. What would she do? What was she to do? She would have to stay with relatives or be out in the street. Now Uhl had no answers. But the countess did. She had a cousin who was seeing a Frenchman, an army officer who worked at the French embassy, a cheerful, generous fellow who, she said, sometimes hired "industrial experts." Was her sweet Edvard not an engineer? Perhaps he ought to meet this man and see what he had to offer. Otherwise, the only hope for the poor countess was to go and stay with her aunt.<br><br>And where was the aunt?<br><br>Chicago.<br><br>Now Uhl wasn't stupid. Or, as he put it to himself, not that stupid. He had a strong suspicion about what was going on. But-and here he surprised himself-he didn't care. The fish saw the worm and wondered if maybe there might just be a hook in there, but, what a delicious worm! Look at it, the most succulent and tasty worm he'd ever seen; never would there be such a worm again, not in this ocean. So . . .<br><br>He first telephoned-to, apparently, a private apartment, because a maid answered in Polish, then switched to German. And, twenty minutes later, Uhl called again and a meeting was arranged. In an hour. At a bar in the Praga district, the workers' quarter across the Vistula from the elegant part of Warsaw. And the Frenchman was, as promised, as cheerful as could be. Likely Alsatian, from the way he spoke German, he was short and tubby, with a soft face that glowed with self-esteem and a certain tilt to the chin and tension in the upper lip that suggested an imminent sneer, while a dapper little mustache did nothing to soften the effect. He was, of course, not in uniform, but wore an expensive sweater and a blue blazer with brass buttons down the front.<br><br>"Henri," he called himself and, yes, he did sometimes employ "industrial experts." His job called for him to stay abreast of developments in particular areas of German industry, and he would pay well for drawings or schematics, any specifications relating to, say, armament or armour. How well? Oh, perhaps five hundred reichsmark a month, for the right papers. Or, if Uhl preferred, a thousand zloty, or two hundred American dollars-some of his experts liked having dollars. The money to be paid in cash or deposited in any bank account, in any name, that Uhl might suggest.<br><br>The word spy was never used, and Henri was very casual about the whole business. Very common, such transactions, his German counterparts did the same thing; everybody wanted to know what was what, on the other side of the border. And, he should add, nobody got caught, as long as they were discreet. What was done privately stayed private. These days, he said, in such chaotic times, smart people understood that their first loyalty was to themselves and their families. The world of governments and shifty diplomats could go to hell, if it wished, but Uhl was obviously a man who was shrewd enough to take care of his own future. And, if he ever found the arrangement uncomfortable, well, that was that. So, think it over, there's no hurry, get back in touch, or just forget you ever met me.<br><br>And the countess? Was she, perhaps, also an, umm, "expert"?<br><br>From Henri, a sophisticated laugh. "My dear fellow! Please! That sort of thing, well, maybe in the movies."<br><br>So, at least the worm wasn't in on it.<br><br>Back at the Europejski-a visit to the new apartment lay still in the future-the countess exceeded herself. Led him to a delight or two that Uhl knew about but had never experienced; her turn to kneel on the carpet. Rapture. Another glass of champagne and further novelty. In time he fell back on the pillow and gazed up at the ceiling, elated and sore. And brave as a lion. He was a shrewd fellow-a single exchange with Henri, and that thousand zloty would see the countess through her difficulties for the next few months. But life never went quite as planned, did it, because Henri, not nearly so cheerful as the first time they'd met, insisted, really did insist, that the arrangement continue.<br><br>And then, in August, instead of Henri, a tall Frenchman called Andr�, quiet and reserved, and much less pleased with himself, and the work he did, than Henri. Wounded, Uhl guessed, in the Great War, he leaned on a fine ebony stick, with a silver wolf's head for a grip.</p><h2>Ouran High School Host Club, Vol. 9</h2><p>Hunny&#39;s little brother, Chika, pays a visit to the Host Club--and immediately starts attacking Hunny, using all his martial-arts prowess against his older brother!

K.A.T. � AudioFile 2004, Portland, Maine-- <i>Copyright � AudioFile, Portland, Maine</i></p><h2>A History of Japan, 1334-1615</h2><p>This is a straightforward narrative of the development of Japanese civilization from 1334 to 1615 by the author of <i>Japan: A Short Cultural History</i>. While complete in itself, it is also the first volume of a three-volume work which will be the first large-scale, comprehensive history of Japan. Taken as a whole, the projected history represents the culmination of the life work of perhaps the most distinguished historian now writing on Japan. Unlike the renowned <i>Short Cultural History</i>, it is concerned mainly with political and social phenomena and only incidentally touches on religion, literature, and the arts. The treatment is primarily descriptive and factual, but the author offers some pragmatic interpretations and suggests comparisons with the history of other peoples. <i>A History of Japan: 1334-1615</i> describes the growth of a new feudal hierarchy, the ebb and flow of civil war, the rise and fall of great families, and the development amidst extreme political disorder of remarkable new features in institutional and economic life. This is the period of expanding relations with other parts of Asia and of the arrival of traders and missionaries from European countries&#x2015;the first contact of Japan with the West. The volume ends with an account of the abortive invasion of Korea and the last outburst of the civil war that was terminated in 1615 by the victory of the first of the Tokugawa Shoguns, Ieyasu.</p><p>&#39;All students of Japanese history will welcome the completion of this history...These volumes, with the author&#39;s earlier works, provide the standard and point of departure for future work in Japanese history.&#39; -The American Historical ReviewSir George Sansom was a British diplomat and historian of pre-modern Japan.

Besides making a new friend, she and Lazlo teach their classmates an important lesson-one that isn't in their schoolbooks-about accepting people who are different...and in getting to know Lazlo, the kids learn that people aren't that different from each other after all.<br><br>From one of America's most respected journalists, <b>The Brand New Kid</b> is a heartwarming story about tolerance and the need to give others a chance that will entertain and inspire children and adults alike.</p><p>On Ellie and Carrie's first day of second grade there's a brand new kid in the class. But when the teacher asks her students to welcome the ultrablond, blue-eyed, pink-lipped, loud-voiced, accent-sporting Lazlo S. Gasky to Brookhaven School, they all mock him instead: "Too different and strange to fit in they all feared." Lazlo grows unhappier by the minute, as he is ostracized and taunted by his classmates. One day, however, when Ellie sees his sad-looking mother walking forlornly toward her car ("Her son's having trouble, she might pull him out, / this school may be wrong for him, she's full of doubt"), things begin to look up for Lazlo. At that moment Ellie begins to wonder what it must be like to be a new kid, feeling so "different and strange," and she decides to take steps to get to know him, even at the risk of facing her friends' ridicule. ("At school the next day the kids stopped her and said, / 'You were walking with Lazlo, are you sick in the head?' / Ellie paused and replied, 'Now I know him, you see, / Lazlo isn't that different from you and from me.'" <p> NBC News' <i>Today</i> coanchor Katie Couric's rhyming book provides a healthy approach to treating people who may be perceived as different, and works well as a springboard to discussion. Though the suddenness of Ellie's turnaround in attitude seems a bit unnatural and the rhymes are often forced ("They arrived at his door greeted by his French poodle / and Mrs. Gasky was there with a plate of warm strudel!"), the message of <i>The Brand New Kid</i> will certainly not be lost on children. As Couric writes in her introduction, "It sometimes takes courage, but I hope this story will inspire all of us to reach out and make someone feel a little less scared and a little less lonely."

With intelligence and lyricism, the book highlights the adventure in getting to each forest and what visitors will find when they arrive. From giant hemlock groves in Pennsylvania to a lonely stand of pines in Wisconsin, each journey provides face-to-face experiences with forests containing majestic trees and a rich diversity of life.

P. T. Barnum&#x2019;s creation of buzz, Pepsodent and the magic of the preemptive claim, Listerine introducing America to the scourge of halitosis, Nike&#x2019;s &#x201c;Just Do It,&#x201d; Clairol&#x2019;s &#x201c;Does She or Doesn&#x2019;t She?,&#x201d; Leo Burnett&#x2019;s invention of the Marlboro Man, Revlon&#x2019;s Charlie Girl, Coke&#x2019;s re-creation of Santa Claus, Absolut and the art world&#x2014;these campaigns are the signposts of a century of consumerism, our modern canon understood, accepted, beloved, and hated the world over.</p><p>James B. Twitchell's celebration of the greatest 20 hits of the U.S. advertising industry shows how a thoughtful consideration of ads can add up to a fascinating social history. From Lydia Pinkham's patent medicines (said to cure all serious "Female Complaints") to Nike shoes worn by Michael Jordan, Twitchell gives us a quickie history of the ads that hit home and transformed our culture--the ones that "really had the beef," as he puts it. Some of the feats are amazing. The dazzling "Diamonds are forever" campaign managed to take not particularly rare rocks and transform them into sacred amulets practically everyone buys and never sells (which would depress their value). The ads brilliantly used honeymoon scenes by famous artists and swoony copy to woo women, while devoting a corner of each ad to fact-packed boxes reassuring men that diamonds were sound investments priced according to scientific principles. The jujitsu-psychology techniques of the VW Bug and Avis "We Try Harder" get their due, as does the "Does She... or Doesn't She?" ad that convinced women they could color their graying hair with Clairol's new one-step technology. The racy innuendo appealed to people fearing loss of appeal; the presence of young daughters in the pictures neutralized the floozy image dyeing used to have, and the line "Only her hairdresser knows for sure" soothed the salons that were about to lose their business once women figured out they could use Clairol at home. <p> There are all kinds of cool stories in this breezy book: how Anacin's $8,200 TV spot depicting a hammer in the headache sufferer's head earned $36 million; how Coke remade Santa literally in its own artist's image; how LBJ beat Goldwater partly because of a single 30-second ad featuring a girl resembling the murder victim in <i>Frankenstein</i> plucking and counting daisy petals while an announcer counts down to a nuclear blast that reminded voters of Goldwater's speeches about nuking Vietnam and made them forget the war was LBJ's fault in the first place. <i>--Tim Appelo</i></p>&#x201c;Succinct and informative, a ... deep look into a deceptively complex subject.&#x201d; &#x2014;Christopher Lehmann-Haupt, <i>New York Times</i><br><br>&#x201c;Easily the Best Book on Advertising&#x201d; &#x2014; Philip Sawyer, director, Starch Advertising Research<br><br>&#x201c;Not a single page is without a cleverly turned sentence, thought-provoking remark, or outrageous conclusion.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>Wired</i><br><br>&#x201c;An immensely entertaining and seriously provocative piece of work . . .

Six Theories of Justice clarifies that question and offers major alternative answers.

These are followed by analysis of three theological approaches: that of the National Conference of Catholic Bishops, of Reinhold Niebuhr, and of the liberation theologian Jose Porfirio Miranda. A comparison of the effectiveness of each approach in providing direction for facing and dealing with contemporary issues and situations adds to the usefulness of this volume.

In this collection of inspiring passages from David R.

Aickman's 'strange stories' (his preferred term for them) are a subtle exploration of psychological displacement and paranoia. His characters are ordinary people that are gradually drawn into the darker recesses of their own minds.<br><br>First published in the USA in 1988 and in the UK in 1990 <i>The Wine-Dark Sea</i> contains eight stories that will leave the reader unsettled as the protagonists' fears and desires, at once illogical and terrifying, culminate in a disturbing yet enigmatic ending.<br><br>For fans of the horror genre Robert Aickman is a must read.</p><p><b>Robert Fordyce Aickman</b> was born in 1914 in London. He was married to Edith Ray Gregorson from 1941 to 1957. In 1946 the couple, along with Tom and Angela Rolt, set up the Inland Waterways Association to preserve the canals of Britain. It was in 1951 that Aickman, along with Elizabeth Jane Howard, published his first ghost stories entitled <i>We Are the Dark</i>. Aickman went on to publish eleven more volumes of horror stories as well as two fantasy novels and two volumes of autobiography. He also edited the first eight volumes of <i>The Fontana Book of Great Ghost Stories</i>. He died in February 1981.Since his death several years ago, British writer Aickman's reputation has continued to grow among connoisseurs of the horror story. Unlike much of the current form, full of blood, monsters and melodrama, Aickman's stories achieve a quieter, more subtle and, in several ways, more lasting sense of disquiet. His lucid, finely tuned prose moves imperceptibly from the small crises and celebrations of ordinary life into another sphere. In these 11 stories, the occasion may be a walking tour of Northern England, a birthday present of a Victorian dollhouse or a stay at a Swedish sanatorium for insomniacs, but it simultaneously traps the characters with dread and opens them up to a new awareness of a greater, deeper and more dangerous world.

David Bentley Hart here meditates on the power of a Christian understanding of beauty and sublimity to rise above the violence -- both philosophical and literal -- characteristic of the postmodern world.<br><br>The book begins by tracing the shifting use and nature of metaphysics in the thought of Kant, Hegel, Nietzsche, Heidegger, Lyotard, Derrida, Deleuze, Nancy, Levinas, and others. Hart pays special attention to Nietzsche's famous narrative of the "will to power" -- a narrative largely adopted by the world today -- and he offers an engaging revision (though not rejection) of the genealogy of nihilism, thereby highlighting the significant "interruption" that Christian thought introduced into the history of metaphysics.<br><br>This discussion sets the stage for a retrieval of the classic Christian account of beauty and sublimity, and of the relation of both to the question of being. Written in the form of a dogmatica minora, this main section of the book offers a pointed reading of the Christian story in four moments, or parts: Trinity, creation, salvation, and eschaton. Through a combination of narrative and argument throughout, Hart ends up demonstrating the power of Christian metaphysics not only to withstand the critiques of modern and postmodern thought but also to move well beyond them.<br><br>Strikingly original and deeply rewarding, <i>The Beauty of the Infinite</i> is both a constructively critical account of the history of metaphysics and a compelling contribution to it.</p><p>David Bentley Hart is a philosopher, theologian, writer, and cultural commentator who has taught at the University of Virginia, Duke University, and Providence College.<i><b>National Review</b></i><br>"David Bentley Hart has written one of the most thrilling works of Christian reflection to come along in years. . .

Reno</b><br>"An elegant, erudite treatment of basic themes in Christian theology, metaphysics, and contemporary cultural criticism. David Bentley Hart has written a book that is both radical and orthodox. The Beauty of the Infinite sets the standard for postmodern theology."<br><br><b>Paul J. Griffiths</b><br>"David Bentley Hart's book shows great patristic and philosophical learning. That is rare enough. Still more rare is the book's compellingly complete theology of beauty. Hart shows that the sublime aesthetic of the market -- this age's chief principality -- can be disrupted by (and perhaps only by) the gospel's radiant beauty. This book makes a major contribution to bringing that disruption about."<br><br><b>Reinhard H�tter</b><br>"Drawing from deep Eastern Orthodox wells, The Beauty of the Infinite achieves an extraordinary theological analysis and transformation of the postmodern condition. A work of breathtaking scope, David Bentley Hart's book combines an impressive mastery of the Christian theological tradition, East and West, with a subtle yet rigorous critique of the philosophical zeitgeist, culminating in a constructive systematic theology of stunning scope. By way of a trinitarian theology of beauty, Hart succeeds in composing a dogmatica minora that radically revises the metaphysical horizon of postmodernity. This book is Christian theology and metaphysics of a high order, an extremely rewarding tour de force."<br><br><b>R. Trent Pomplun</b><br>"David Bentley Hart -- like Soloviev and Florensky before him -- stands in the finest tradition of virile Eastern alternatives to modern Western philosophy and theology.

This magnificent and demanding volume should establish David Bentley Hart, around the world no less than in North America, as one of his generation's leading theologians."<br><br><b>John Milbank</b><br>"David Hart is already the best living American systematic theologian. The Beauty of the Infinite is his first major work."<br><br><b>Janet Martin Soskice in <i>Times Literary Supplement</i></b><br>"A splendid book. . . Hart's prose is trenchant but often beautiful. There are penetrating, and frequently amusing, critiques of Foucault, Bultmann, and Deleuze, among others. . . The Beauty of the Infinite shows the vigor and power of theology, ancient and modern."<br><br><b><i>Nova et Vetera</i></b><br>"Despite the relative youth of its author, The <i>Beauty of the Infinite</i> merits consideration as one of the most ambitious and theologically insightful contributions to the field in the past decade. David Hart's fluid prose, sweeping grasp of theology and continental philosophy, and creativity enables him to ferry the reader from eastern patristic theology to French postmodernism, from Greek Attic tragedy to Nietzsche and Heidegger. His work deserves a careful reading by all serious students of theology."<br><br><b><i>The Journal of Religion</i></b><br>"On every page of <i>The Beauty of the Infinite</i> are provocative and original readings. Hart debunks many unexamined pieties nascent in the postmodern idiom and, at the same time, displays his own genius for rhetorical invention. Hyperarticulate and a great phrasemaker, Hart will please the logophile as well as the philologist; his erudition . . . and his eloquence . .</p><h2>Vertigo 42: A Richard Jury Mystery</h2><p>The inimitable Richard Jury returns in the latest in the bestselling mystery series: &#x201c;Martha Grimes has written a whodunit with terrific characters and a grand plot mixed with her unique droll wit. <i>Vertigo 42 </i>is one smart mystery!&#x201d; (Susan Isaacs, bestselling author of <i>Goldberg Variations</i>)<br><br>Richard Jury is meeting Tom Williamson at Vertigo 42, a bar on the forty-second floor of an office building in London&#x2019;s financial district.

This lot (he had checked the wine list) was costing Mr. Williamson in the vicinity of 385 quid. One bottle. That much. It was Krug. Was wine this expensive meant to be swallowed? Or just held in the mouth as the eye held on to the barges streaked with orange light there on the river.<br> <br>The waiter returned with a dish of incandescent green olives, big ones; he placed them on the counter that ran beneath the window and between the rather trendy-looking but very comfortable chairs.<br> <br>Jury was there to meet not an old friend, but a friend of an old friend, Sir Oswald Maples. The friend of the friend was Williamson, who had ordered the champagne. Oswald Maples had asked Jury if he could spare some time to talk to Tom Williamson, and Jury said, &#x201c;Of course. Why?&#x201d; To which Oswald had said, &#x201c;You&#x2019;ll see.&#x201d; Jury filled his glass again before he moved to another window and another view of the Thames.<br> <br>&#x201c;My favorite view,&#x201d; said a voice behind him. Jury turned.<br> <br>&#x201c;Superintendent Jury? I&#x2019;m Tom Williamson. I&#x2019;m very sorry I&#x2019;m late.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not,&#x201d; said Jury, lifting the Krug from its ice bed. &#x201c;You will notice this is considerably below the waterline.&#x201d;<br> <br>Tom Williamson laughed and poured a measure into his own glass. He was a tall man, taller by an inch than Jury himself. &#x201c;Fortunately, there&#x2019;s a lot more sea.&#x201d; He raised his glass, tipped it toward Jury&#x2019;s. &#x201c;You like ships, Superintendent?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know anything about them, except there&#x2019;s a waterline on the hull.&#x201d;<br> <br>Tom smiled. &#x201c;I love them. My grandfather was in the shipping business. Down there used to be steamships of the East India Company loaded with stuff&#x2014;tea, spices, as many as a thousand ships going toward the docks. And barges. Now we&#x2019;ve got tourist cruisers and speedboats. Still a lot of river traffic, just not the same traffic. Thanks for meeting me.&#x201d;<br> <br>The thanks came without a pause between it and the river traffic. The way he talked, the directness, as if he didn&#x2019;t want to waste any time, made Jury smile. Williamson had yet to remove his coat, which he now did, and tossed it over one of the coolly blue amoeba-shaped chairs.<br> <br>&#x201c;An interesting bar to choose,&#x201d; said Jury. &#x201c;Light-years above the ones I frequent down there.&#x201d; He nodded toward the window and approaching dark. &#x201c;Do you work in the City?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No. I know nothing about finance. You wonder why I chose it?&#x201d;<br> <br>Jury laughed. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not complaining, believe me. It must have the best views of anyplace in London.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes. I don&#x2019;t come here often.&#x201d; He sat back. &#x201c;Perhaps I chose it because up here is quite literally above it all.&#x201d; He sipped some champagne.<br> <br>Jury smiled. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s the &#x2018;all&#x2019;?&#x201d;<br> <br>Williamson looked perplexed.<br> <br>&#x201c;That you want to be above?&#x201d;<br> <br>Williamson picked up an olive but didn&#x2019;t eat it. He put it on one of the small paper napkins the waiter had supplied. &#x201c;You know a man with the Devon-Cornwall police. A Commander Macalvie?&#x201d;<br> <br>Jury was so surprised by this sudden segue he spilled his champagne, fortunately only on himself. &#x201c;Sorry.&#x201d; He brushed at the spill with a napkin. &#x201c;Brian Macalvie? I certainly do. But it was Sir Oswald Maples who spoke to me about you&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Of course. I&#x2019;m sorry. I&#x2019;m tossing too many balls in the air.&#x201d; He plucked the bottle from its stand and poured more for each of them. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know how much Oswald told you . . .&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Nothing, other than that you worked for the Government Code and Cipher School, GC and CS. Not when he was there, but after it changed to GC Headquarters and got moved to Cheltenham.&#x201d;<br> <br>Tom Williamson nodded.<br> <br>Jury went on: &#x201c;Sir Oswald knows I&#x2019;m a sucker for that stuff. I stopped at Bletchley Park to see the Enigma machine. It was incredible work they did, Alan Turing and the others.&#x201d;<br> <br>Williamson said, &#x201c;Oswald was at Bletchley Park during the war. He was really into it, very high up. I wasn&#x2019;t so much; my work was small potatoes by comparison. Your name came up&#x2014;that is, he thought of you when I was visiting him one evening in Chelsea. It&#x2019;s about my wife, Tess.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Your wife?&#x201d; Jury looked over his shoulder, quite stupidly, as if he expected to find Tess there, behind their chairs.<br> <br>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s dead.&#x201d;<br> <br>Somehow, Jury had known that, even as he turned to look for her.<br> <br>&#x201c;Seventeen years ago.&#x201d; He paused long enough to have counted every one. &#x201c;We had&#x2014;I still have&#x2014;a house in Devon, very large, too large for us, certainly. Woods, extensive gardens, tiered and rather Italianate, I suppose, and too much to maintain, even with the gardener, who&#x2019;s been there for years. But Tess wasn&#x2019;t really interested in bringing it back, as they say, to its former glory. She liked the unruliness of it, the wildness. She was a bit of a romantic, Tess.&#x201d;<br> <br>It had grown dark now and the lights had come on along the Embankment and across the river in Southwark. &#x201c;I met Tess in Norfolk, along the coast. We liked to watch the lights in the harbor. That&#x2019;s the other reason I like this bar. Down there. The lights coming on.&#x201d; He stopped.<br> <br>Jury waited.<br> <br>Tom cleared his throat and went on. &#x201c;I was talking about our house in Devon. As for me, I saw a lot of unkempt lawn, tangled vines, rioting weeds, and tree rot.&#x201d; The laugh was perfunctory, not happy. &#x201c;At the rear of the house in the gardens there were&#x2014;are&#x2014;two concrete pools, ornamental once, I expect. Empty now. There&#x2019;s a wide patio and a flight of wide stone steps. Urns placed strategically round the patio and at the top and bottom of the stairs.&#x201d; He looked away from the dark Thames below, curving in the distance. &#x201c;Excuse all of the detail, but this is where she died, you see. At the bottom of these stairs. Tess was given to attacks of vertigo.&#x201d;<br> <br>Jury felt disturbed by this accounting because he knew behind it lay another accounting.<br> <br>&#x201c;She apparently&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>Jury could see the man&#x2019;s mouth working to get beyond &#x201c;apparently&#x201d; and said it for him. &#x201c;Fell.&#x201d;<br> <br>Williamson nodded. &#x201c;Her head hit a stone plinth at the bottom. Pedestal of an urn. Grecian.&#x201d;<br> <br>As if Keats might help out here.<br> <br>Then to keep going, Tom took a pack of Silk Cuts from his pocket, stuck one in his mouth before he remembered to offer the pack to Jury, who, after gazing at the cigarette for half his life, declined. Tom lit one with a cheap, no-nonsense lighter, which he placed on the table beside the cigarettes. The man was obviously wealthy but didn&#x2019;t express it in silver cigarette cases and lighters.<br> <br>Out of another pocket he took a folded paper. It was worn with creases from countless refoldings. &#x201c;This is a poem she liked by Eliot; the book was given her by a photographer friend. It sounds almost like directions for a pose, doesn&#x2019;t it?&#x201d; Tom smiled a little and read:<br> <br>&#x201c;Stand on the highest pavement of the stair&#x2014;<br> <br>Lean on a garden urn&#x2014;<br> <br>Weave, weave the sunlight in your hair . . .&#x201d;<br> <br>Setting aside the poem for the moment, he reached into the breast pocket of his jacket and took out a small picture, hardly more than a snapshot, but paper of studio quality. A portrait in little. &#x201c;This is Tess.&#x201d;<br> <br>Jury took it. &#x201c;The pose is like the poem, yes.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It is. I&#x2019;ve the original photograph at home. Tess was pretty.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s an understatement, Mr. Williamson.&#x201d; Jury felt, for some reason, oddly forlorn.<br> <br>&#x201c; &#x2018;Tom,&#x2019; please.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Where is home? Devon?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Devon? Oh, no. Not that house. I live in Knightsbridge. That&#x2019;s our London house.&#x201d;<br> <br>Jury went back to the problem, or what he took it to be: &#x201c;There would have been a police inquiry. What was the result?&#x201d;<br> <br>Williamson shrugged, as if the result were irrelevant. &#x201c;Open verdict. There wasn&#x2019;t enough evidence to determine one way or another.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You didn&#x2019;t agree.&#x201d;<br> <br>Enter, Brian Macalvie. He would probably have been a detective inspector seventeen years back. &#x201c;Was Commander Macalvie&#x2014;he wouldn&#x2019;t have been commander then&#x2014;was he the primary on this?&#x201d;<br> <br>Tom shook his head. &#x201c;The man in charge was a Chief Inspector Bishop, no, Bishoff. He was convinced it was accidental. There was, of course, reason to believe it was an accident because of the vertigo. The steps there are high.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;But they were her steps.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Precisely. She was all too familiar with them. Chief Inspector Bishoff made the point that it was probably a misstep, or something fallen on one of the steps, in her path. But it wasn&#x2019;t. No, I&#x2019;m sure someone arranged to have it look like an accident.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;But why did you think that? Purely on the basis that it wasn&#x2019;t vertigo that caused it?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No.&#x201d; His fingers were on the stem of his champagne flute. He turned and turned the glass. &#x201c;No. It was the way Tess was lying.&#x201d; He looked toward the window.<br> <br>Jury was sure he wasn&#x2019;t seeing London beyond it.<br> <br>&#x201c;She was lying with her arms outflung, the flowers she&#x2019;d been carrying scattered.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Do you think it was some sort of enactment of the figure in the poem?&#x201d;<br> <br>Tom read more lines from the poem still lying on the table:<br> <br>&#x201c;Clasp your flowers to you with a pained surprise&#x2014;<br> <br>Fling them to the ground and turn<br> <br>With a fugitive resentment in your eyes.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It did look a little like it. Arranged.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What about this photographer, then?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Andrew Cleary. She called him Angel Clare, after the character in Tess of the D&#x2019;Urbervilles; she was very fond of Thomas Hardy. He had nothing to do with her death; he was in Paris.&#x201d;<br> <br>Jury was silent for a moment. Then he said, &#x201c;Was there someone you think had a reason to kill your wife?&#x201d;<br> <br>He did not answer but rose and took a couple of steps toward the window.<br> <br>Jury had the strange feeling Tom was in some way reentering his wife&#x2019;s death, standing there as if there were a stone stairway down to Old Broad Street. Then he turned back, sat down. &#x201c;There was an incident, something pretty dreadful that involved Tess five years before she died. I said &#x2018;incident.&#x2019; Ridiculous. It was more than that; it was another accident at the same house, the same rear gardens . . .&#x201d; He rubbed the heel of his palm against the side of his head, as if trying to call something up.<br> <br>&#x201c;Tess had a party for some children at Laburnum. That&#x2019;s the name of our Devon house. Six of them, the children. Tess was very fond of children and we had none, unfortunately. She would get up parties for kids, their birthdays, or holidays, even arcane Welsh or Scottish holidays most of us have never heard of . . .&#x201d; He moved his shoulders a little, as if resettling a coat around his neck. As if he were cold.<br> <br>&#x201c;Anyway&#x201d;&#x2014;he continued with the story&#x2014;&#x201c;at one of these parties at Laburnum, a child named Hilda Palmer fell into one of the drained pools. They were concrete pools, fairly deep. They should have been filled or fenced and Tess was in the process of organizing that; she was lining up an Exeter firm; unfortunately it hadn&#x2019;t been done yet. Of course, the kids had been told not to play at the rear of the house in the gardens around those pools. But Hilda went round, apparently, when they were playing, got near the pool, missed her footing, and fell in.<br> <br>&#x201c;Tess was in the house, getting the cake and other party food ready. It was somebody&#x2019;s birthday. She heard a shout, some noise. The kids were supposed to keep to the front of the house&#x2014;this is a large house, as I told you, with extensive gardens and woods.<br> <br>&#x201c;What she told us was that she went out to investigate, but didn&#x2019;t see anything. She went down the steps and looked around, saw nothing, heard nothing, and then she got closer to the drained pools. There was Hilda lying crumpled at the bottom. She wasn&#x2019;t moving. Tess said she thought she was unconscious and jumped down into the pool. But Hilda wasn&#x2019;t breathing. She was dead. Just like that.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;How terrible.&#x201d;<br> <br>Tom closed his eyes briefly, shaking his head. &#x201c;The children told her they were playing hide-and-seek. So they didn&#x2019;t see which way the others had gone. Behind a tree, into the maze, into the shrubbery . . . They were all in different places.&#x201d; Nervously, Tom picked up his packet of cigarettes and lit one.<br> <br>This had happened over twenty years before, yet it still made the man&#x2019;s hands shake. &#x201c;That this Hilda Palmer missed her footing and fell in, this was the inference drawn by police?&#x201d;<br> <br>Tom shook his head. &#x201c;This was the inference Tess drew. No one saw anything. When she discovered the girl was dead she yelled for help. Elaine Davies, a friend of Tess, and the kids all came running. Tess called the police; the ambulance came; detectives and all of their people came.<br> <br>&#x201c;So to answer your question: the inference drawn by police was that Hilda Palmer was killed by someone; that she was struck, and that&#x2019;s what caused her fall. There was a good deal of blood. Tess had it on her hands, her dress. The coroner argued that there appeared to be no reason for the fall; that is, unless the child was given to bouts of dizziness. Police said there was nothing around the pools that anyone could trip over&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>Jury snorted. &#x201c;She could have tripped over her own feet, tripped over air.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I know. But that was the argument.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Why would someone have tried to kill her?&#x201d;<br> <br>Tom shook his head. &#x201c;Hilda was only a child, nine years old, but she was an unpopular child. She was a bit of a bully. But worse, she had even gotten some adult backs up because she seemed to be able to ferret out information, God knows how, and would hold it over people&#x2019;s heads.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Blackmail, then.&#x201d;<br> <br>Tom shrugged. &#x201c;Something like that.&#x201d; He pulled their ch...</p><h2>Hitler&#39;s First Hundred Days: When Germans Embraced the Third Reich</h2><p><b>The breathtaking rise of Hitler in 1933 -- and the making of the Nazis</b><br>Amid the ravages of economic depression, Germans in the early 1930s were pulled to political extremes both left and right.

As Malcolm was bounding into Harlem&#x2019;s local political arena, Harold Cruse was settling downtown, still clinging to wistful dreams that he had, temporarily at least, put on hold. As a young boy, Harold Cruse dreamed of becoming a writer. For a southern-born black boy coming of age in the Great Depression, this was an ambitious goal, with long odds. Born in Petersburg, Virginia, in 1916, Cruse moved as a young boy to New York City as part of the exodus to northern cities that would shortly transform African American life. The then-largest internal migration in American history sowed the seeds for Harlem&#x2019;s emergence as a cultural mecca that would become the headquarters for black political resistance, intellectual achievement, and cultural innovation. A second great migration, which started during the early 1940s, of southern-born blacks (which eventually eclipsed its earlier counterpart in both density and geographical breadth), extended to cities and regions recently buoyed by the movement for civil rights. Coalitions of civil rights activists, trade unionists, Communists, and Pan-Africanists led strategic campaigns for racial justice and radical democracy that stretched from gritty Harlem neighborhoods through Detroit&#x2019;s industrial shop floors to Dixie&#x2019;s cradle, Birmingham, Alabama, and out west to Oakland&#x2019;s postwar boomtown.1<br><br>Cruse&#x2019;s favorite time was spent reading books at the local library. It was no ordinary public library. Harlem was home to the New York Public Library&#x2019;s Negro History Division, a repository of black history and culture founded by the Afro-Puerto Rican bibliophile, historian, and curator Arturo Schomburg. Schomburg&#x2019;s passion for African, Caribbean, and African American history provided the residents of Harlem&#x2019;s black community a window onto its past.2<br><br>In the 1950s, black nationalists stalked Harlem like itinerant Baptist preachers in search of wayward flocks, wistful for the heady post-World War I years, when &#x201c;New Negroes&#x201d; reshaped Afro-America with a dose of militancy as effervescent as it was unprecedented. Marcus Mosiah Garvey&#x2019;s dynamic presence had fueled this golden age, when the Universal African Legions (soldiers in Garvey&#x2019;s Universal Negro Improvement Association) held Harlem captive with precision marching, ornate uniforms, and defiantly proud stares.3 No sooner had Garvey overcome what appeared to be insurmountable organizational, financial, and political obstacles than his movement collapsed, victimized by internal ineptitude, government surveillance, and jealous rivals. Garvey&#x2019;s arrest on charges of mail fraud, and subsequent incarceration during the mid-1920s, made room for other advocates of interracial class struggle who, during the height of the New Negro, could barely be heard above the din of nationalist fervor.<br><br>If Garvey&#x2019;s absence created space for radicals, the Great Depression invited another front in the war for racial equality: class-based political agitation. With organizing energies fueled by social crises, the Communist Party (CP) made small, but surprisingly robust, headway in Harlem. While Garvey stoked controversy through grand gestures aimed at coaxing dignity from Africa&#x2019;s descendants, the CP offered a Promethean vision of class struggle. As Cruse remembered, anyone who couldn&#x2019;t debate the finer points of Marx and Engels was &#x201c;considered a goddamned dummy!&#x201d;4<br><br>By the late 1930s, the Depression introduced the possibilities of social, cultural, and political revolution at home and abroad and reached Harlem&#x2019;s street corners, barbershops, churches, and other institutions. Much of Cruse&#x2019;s early political education took place at the Harlem YMCA, which served as a debating society, intellectual training ground, and incubator for what Cruse later described as a hotbed of political activity. The all-black neighborhood blurred class distinctions among Afro-Americans, where Harlemites rubbed shoulders with leading black literary lights.5 Virtually every block of Harlem was up for grabs: nationalists exhorting on one corner, while Socialists and others set up their headquarters fifty yards away. Pamphlets on class struggle, Pan-Africanism, and trade unionism compressed decades of social history into easily digestible prose. Walking through parts of Harlem, you risked being bombarded by pamphleteers selling, or sometimes giving away, propaganda that recounted the history of Negro oppression and offered a blueprint for black liberation.<br><br>Fascism&#x2019;s triumphs in parts of Europe and Africa gave black Americans the opportunity to fight for freedoms abroad that they were denied at home. For blacks the fight against an overseas enemy lent urgency to domestic struggles for racial justice. Stationed in a supply company in Italy and North Africa, Cruse became friendly with Italian Communists. There were pragmatic reasons for such friendships. Preyed on by hijackers and other criminal elements, vulnerable black supply officers negotiated with the Italian Underground as a matter of professional survival and personal protection.6<br><br>Cruse returned home, more politically conscious and worldly, to a Harlem that had also matured. In fact, postwar New York City became a battleground for some of the most militant and cosmopolitan efforts to achieve racial equality in the United States, and Harlem was the movement&#x2019;s nerve center.7 For instance, seizing opportunities created by postwar momentum for progressive politics, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People--the NAACP--and the Council on African Affairs joined forces to promote a human rights platform for the nascent United Nations.8 Groups such as the National Negro Labor Congress and the Civil Rights Congress, as well as leading black intellectuals (Paul Robeson, Richard Wright, and Langston Hughes among them), established relationships with Communists that ranged from dangerous flirtation to intimate association.9 Communists, through support of black criminal defendants, sharecroppers, trade unionists, artists, and writers, also played an important, hotly debated role among black activists during this period. Black sympathizers, not to mention members, viewed the CP as a potential vehicle for liberation, while anti-Communists suspected the group of playing African Americans for dupes (a fear promoted by the federal government). The majority of black folk remained neutral, accepting the CP&#x2019;s support in certain instances of bald-faced racial injustice while never coming close to becoming professional members. In 1946, Cruse officially joined the Communist Party. Like many in his generation, he entered radical politics at the peak of its post-World War II popularity, only to come of age amid its steady decline during the Cold War.<br><br>From rural hamlets and small southern cities to giant urban metropolises, the black postwar generation challenged racial discrimination in industry, labor, housing, and domestic and foreign policy. Paul Robeson, the broad-shouldered Renaissance man who possessed the physique of a football player, the mind of an intellectual, and a sonorous bass voice that thrilled a global listening audience, emerged as the most popular spokesperson for black insurgency during the 1940s.10<br><br>Robeson&#x2019;s radicalism was rooted in his identification with underdogs of every race, color, and creed, an advocacy that found him proclaiming solidarity with indigenous people from Africa to the Soviet Union. Yet while leaders such as Robeson served as invaluable political mobilizers, a national black freedom movement was brokered, block by block, at the local level by far less glamorous figures.11 Ella Baker (future founder of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee), in her capacity as the NAACP&#x2019;s branch director, helped this process unfold in cities like New York through grassroots organizing efforts that stressed cooperation with trade unions affiliated with the left-wing Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO).12<br><br>If the end of the war ushered in dramatic changes for black Americans, it also exposed enduring problems. Wartime race riots, most infamously Detroit&#x2019;s 1943 orgy of violence sparked by competition over jobs and housing, bared the enormity of the unresolved crisis. Rising expectations of black veterans met with racial violence, precarious employment opportunities, and a blatant defense of segregation that found local voice from Harlem to the Mississippi Delta to parts west and national representation among powerful Washington politicians.<br><br>International events paralleled, and at times intersected with, postwar black freedom struggles; events in Africa proved pivotal in this regard. The rapid decolonization of African states fostered domestic and international pan-African alliances, anchored by the stately presence of Afro-America&#x2019;s legendary intellectual propagandist W. E. B. Du Bois and the controversial outspokenness of Paul Robeson. Domestically, an assortment of militant organizations mirrored these developments, jointly promoting antiracism at home and human rights abroad.13<br><br>Postwar black activism heralded new hopes for racial justice in every facet of American life, though such hopes were offset by a presidential directive that established a hard peace through the threat of global war. The Truman Doctrine offered a picture of international, multiracial democracy that was, in theory, tantalizingly expansive. In practice, Truman&#x2019;s foreign policies created a domestic political order that sacrificed freedoms of speech and political association, not to mention agendas for racial and economic justice, at the altar of what he proclaimed to be a larger evil--Communist totalitarianism. Remnants of the black freedom struggle responded in different ways to...</p></p><h2>The Enemy at the Gate: Habsburgs, Ottomans, and the Battle for Europe</h2><p><b>An acclaimed history of the Great Siege of Vienna, when the Ottoman Empire and the Habsburg dynasty came face to face</b><br>In 1683, an Ottoman army that stretched from horizon to horizon set out to seize Vienna, the bulwark of Christendom. The ensuing siege pitted battle-hardened Janissaries wielding seventeenth-century grenades against Habsburg armies widely feared for their savagery. The walls of Vienna bristled with guns as the besieging Ottoman host launched bombs, fired cannons, and showered the populace with arrows. Each side was sustained by the hatred of its age-old enemy, certain that victory would be won by the grace of God.The Great Siege of Vienna is the centerpiece of historian Andrew Wheatcroft's richly drawn portrait of the complex centuries-long rivalry between the Ottoman and Habsburg empires for control of the European continent.

The other story is of the obsessive fear and hatred of the Turks in Christian central Europe, exorcised by the Habsburg victory at Vienna, turning to revenge and reconquest led first by Duke Charles of Lorraine, then by the legendary Prince Eugene of Savoy, ending in exhausted and bankrupt stability."&#x2015;<b><i><b><i>Washington Times</i></b></i></b><br><br>"[A] riveting narrative, Andrew Wheatcroft's <i>The Enemy at the Gate</i>...tells the story of the final Habsburg-Ottoman showdown at the gates of Vienna in 1683, one of the genuine turning points in European history."&#x2015;<b><i><b><i>Telegraph</i></b></i></b></p><h2>Dawn (Warriors: The New Prophecy, Book 3)</h2><p><p><strong>Erin Hunter&#x2019;s #1 nationally bestselling Warriors series continues with the third book in the New Prophecy series!</strong></p><p>The third book in this second series,&nbsp;<em>Warriors: The New Prophecy #3: Dawn,</em>&nbsp;brings more adventure, intrigue, and thrilling battles to the epic world of the warrior Clans.</p><p>The young cats who set off on a quest many moons ago have returned with a chilling message: the Clans must move to a new home or risk extermination.</p><p>But the dangers waiting for them beyond their borders are impossible to predict, and the cats have no idea where to go.

In the first book of its kind, Garland-Thomson defines staring, explores the factors that motivate it, and considers the targets and the effects of the stare. While borrowing from psychology and biology to help explain why the impulse to stare is so powerful, she also enlarges and complicates these formulations with examples from the realm of imaginative culture. Featuring over forty illustrations, <em>Staring</em> captures the stimulating combination of symbolic, material and emotional factors that make staring so irresistible while endeavoring to shift the usual response to staring, shame, into an engaged self-consideration. Elegant and provocative, this unique study advances new ways of thinking about visuality and the body that will appeal to readers who are interested in the overlap between the humanities and human behaviors.<br></p><p><br>Rosemarie Garland-Thomson is Professor in the Department of Women's Studies at Emory University.

But enough of that. Garland-Thomson takes staring as the inevitability it is, and, with compelling stories and beautiful insight, tells us where we <em>could</em> go from here-intellectually, socially, artistically, humanely. -Alice Dreger, Professor of Clinical Medical Humanities and Bioethics, Northwestern University<p></p><br>"'So I stared at him . . . I felt really ill-at-ease . . . .'

Congress was in an uproar over slavery, and it was not clear if a compromise could be found. In the midst of the debate, President Zachary Taylor suddenly took ill and died. The presidency, and the crisis, now fell to the little-known vice president from upstate New York.</p><p>In this eye-opening biography, the legal scholar and historian Paul Finkelman reveals how Millard Fillmore's response to the crisis he inherited set the country on a dangerous path that led to the Civil War. He shows how Fillmore stubbornly catered to the South, alienating his fellow Northerners and creating a fatal rift in the Whig Party, which would soon disappear from American politics&#x2015;as would Fillmore himself, after failing to regain the White House under the banner of the anti-immigrant and anti-Catholic "Know Nothing" Party.</p><p>Though Fillmore did have an eye toward the future, dispatching Commodore Matthew Perry on the famous voyage that opened Japan to the West and on the central issues of the age&#x2015;immigration, religious toleration, and most of all slavery&#x2015;his myopic vision led to the destruction of his presidency, his party, and ultimately, the Union itself.</p></p><p><p><b>Paul Finkelman</b> is the author of <i>Dred Scott v.

He lives in Slingerlands, New York.</p><p>1</p> <p>Portrait of a Young Man from Nowhere</p> <p>The president's death caught the nation by surprise. At sixty-five Zachary Taylor had been one of the oldest men elected to the office, but he was strong and hardy. A lifelong soldier, he had led armies and endured combat in snowy Midwest forests, steamy Florida swamps, and, most recently, in ovenlike Southwestern deserts. Taylor had fought the British, the Mexicans, and numerous Indian nations. "Old Rough and Ready," as his troops affectionately called him, was a tough soldier. Who would have imagined that just sixteen months into his term he would die from gastroenteritis&#x2014;a massive stomachache? There were rumors that Taylor had been poisoned, and in the most literal sense that was probably true. The gastroenteritis may have killed him, but it is just as likely the hero of the Mexican War died from the treatment of his physicians in the age of "heroic medicine." His doctors bled him, put blisters on him, and gave him massive doses of calomel, a mercury compound that is indeed poisonous. Either way, the end result was the death of a popular and tough president on July 9, 1850. For the second time in the nation's history, an "accidental president" would take the oath of office.1</p> <p>Taylor's presidency and death were weirdly similar to the only other president who had died in office, William Henry Harrison, who had served for just one month in 1841. Popular generals and war heroes, both were well past sixty when they were elected. Both were Whigs&#x2014;the only candidates of that party ever to have been elected to the presidency. Both were southern-born slave owners, although Harrison had relocated to Ohio as a relatively young man.2 However, the background and stature of the men who replaced each deceased president were completely dissimilar. John Tyler, Harrison's vice president, who became the first accidental president, was a significant figure. His wealthy father had been governor of Virginia. After graduating from the College of William and Mary, Tyler began his long prepresidential career at age twenty-one when he was elected to the state legislature. He later served as a congressman, governor, and U.S. senator, and he was elected president pro tempore of the Senate. When he was offered the vice presidential nomination in 1840, he was nationally prominent.</p> <p>Millard Fillmore, who became president after Taylor's death, was inexperienced and virtually unknown when he was nominated for vice president at the 1848 Whig convention. He was born in poverty in central New York, poorly schooled as a child, and largely self-educated after that. He achieved a comfortable middle-class status and struggled to fit in with men who were better educated, culturally more sophisticated, and more socially adept than he. Moving to Buffalo, he practiced law and entered politics at age twenty-eight, serving three terms in the state legislature and later four terms in Congress. He was an unsuccessful candidate for governor of New York in 1844, but in 1847 he was elected state comptroller&#x2014;an important but hardly a major office. A year later, this obscure politician was nominated to run for vice president alongside General Taylor.</p> <p>Fillmore's presidency would be much like Tyler's. He is remembered as a thoroughly unsuccessful president who catered to the South at the expense of the North and energetically favored slavery over liberty. He alienated the party that nominated him for the vice presidency and, in the end, abandoned his party. The second accidental president, like the first, was a failure. Tyler left office rejected by his party. The same is true for Fillmore, except he also left office vilified in much of his home state and region. The final political ventures of both accidental presidents added no luster to their memory. Tyler's political career ended disgracefully. A man who had taken an oath "to preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States"3 turned traitor, accepted a position in the Confederate government, and helped make war on the nation he once led. Fillmore's career did not end in treason, but it is hardly praiseworthy. Desperate to regain the presidency, in 1856 he ran as the candidate of the anti-immigrant, anti-Catholic American Party&#x2014;better known as the Know-Nothings. His campaign as the candidate of ethnic and religious bigotry ended in abysmal failure; he carried only one state, Maryland, which ironically had been founded in the seventeenth century as a haven for Catholics.</p> <p>After his defeat as the Know-Nothing presidential candidate, Fillmore devoted his life to charity, local public service, and personal comfort, and until the Civil War he kept out of politics. Following the death of his first wife, he remarried a wealthy widow, and he spent the last eighteen years of his life basking in the glow of being a former president. To his credit, he supported the Union cause at the beginning of the Civil War, raised some money for war relief, and even organized a unit of aging men to serve as a more or less symbolic home guard. But the former president failed to follow most of his Whig contemporaries into the Republican Party. In 1864 he backed the Democratic candidate, George B. McClellan, once again supporting appeasement of the South and slavery. Like McClellan, Fillmore opposed emancipation, the enlistment of black troops, and expanding racial equality. Out of step with his neighbors, his former Whig allies, and the North, he became politically irrelevant. After the Civil War, he engaged in civic enterprises and boosterism for his adopted home of Buffalo, New York, where he died in 1874, forgotten by most of the nation and remembered, if at all, for his odd first name and his failed presidency.</p> <p>Yet for a short moment, from July 1850 until March 1853, Millard Fillmore sat in the White House, at the center of American politics. His term coincided with one of the great crises of American history, and his leadership, or lack thereof, did little to either solve the nation's problems or reduce its tensions. Indeed, his presidency exacerbated both.</p>&#x2022;&#x2022;&#x2022; <p></p> <p>The first son of Nathaniel and Phoebe Fillmore, the future president was born on January 7, 1800, on an isolated farm at the southern end of Cayuga County, New York, west of present-day Syracuse.4 His unusual first name was his mother's maiden name, a common practice among New Englanders, which the Fillmores had been until 1799, when they gave up farming the rocky soil of Vermont in the belief that central New York offered better land and more opportunity. Their faith was misplaced. The soil was poor, the winters were harsh, and they lost the land they purchased because of an inadequate survey and uncertain titles. The Fillmores then rented a farm in the nearby village of Sempronius, on Lake Skaneateles, about twenty-five miles from Auburn, where Fillmore's chief rival in New York politics, William H. Seward, would begin his career. Renting, rather than owning, land was a huge decline in social status for the Fillmores in a community where independence and self-respect were tied to land ownership.</p> <p>It was in Sempronius that Millard learned to farm and gained a rudimentary education in the local elementary school. Nathaniel Fillmore, hoping for a better future for his son, apprenticed Millard to learn the trade of wool carding and cloth dressing. Over the next four years, Millard worked as an apprentice in a textile mill, where he also did some bookkeeping. At seventeen Millard paid to join a new private library and began reading voraciously. In 1819, with the mill temporarily closed (perhaps from the fallout of the financial panic that year), Millard enrolled in a recently opened local academy, where he was introduced to new fields of knowledge. He also met his future wife Abigail Powers, a teacher in the school. She was two years his senior, the daughter of a deceased Baptist minister and the sister of a local judge. Abigail was well read and as sophisticated as one could become at the time in a tiny town in rural central New York. At about this time Nathaniel Fillmore persuaded a county judge, Walter Wood, to take in Millard as a law clerk. Two months into his legal education the mill reopened.</p> <p>Throughout this period Fillmore was legally still apprenticed to the mill, so he was technically required to return to the textile factory. Judge Wood wanted Fillmore to remain, lending him money and promising some paid work if he would stay. Fillmore continued to live at home, taught school, used his earnings to buy his way out of his apprenticeship at the mill, and returned to Judge Wood. However, reading the law and clerking under the autocratic judge soon became unbearable, while the pittance Wood paid him left Fillmore impoverished. About eighteen months after he returned to read the law under Wood, Fillmore accepted a few dollars to represent someone in a case before a justice of the peace. Fillmore needed the extra money, and by successfully negotiating a settlement before the case was heard, he hoped Judge Wood would not find out what he had done. Although admission to the bar was not required to practice law before a justice of the peace, it was clearly inappropriate for a law clerk to freelance in this way without the permission of the lawyer for whom he worked. Wood soon discovered this insubordination and properly reprimanded his clerk. The headstrong young Fillmore stormed off and returned to his father's farm. Shortly after, the entire Fillmore family moved to East Aurora, near Buffalo. Millard taught school again and argued a few more justice of the peace cases. Six feet tall, strikingly handsome, and ambitious for a better life, Millard Fillmore turned twenty-one with few prospects. He and Abigail announced their engagement, but she remained with her mother, teaching school in Cayuga County.</p> <p>Fillmore, now of legal majority and emancipated from his father, was free to strike out on his own. He moved to Buffalo, where he once again taught school and found an attorney under whom he could read the law. He was meticulously dressed, well spoken, and clearly smart. He was orthodox in his thinking and circumspect in his politics. If he had any ideals, no one knew what they were, but he was generally cautious, conservative, serious, studious, and hardworking. In his first year clerking in Buffalo, Fillmore so impressed members of the local bar that they secured his early admission, allowing him to practice at the age of twenty-three.</p> <p>Fillmore rejected offers to join existing Buffalo practices and returned to East Aurora, where he was the only attorney in town. His small-town legal work&#x2014;wills, real estate, debt collection&#x2014;allowed him to earn a decent living and teach himself how to practice law. It was a curious choice, since he would have learned more quickly if he had stayed on as a junior attorney in Buffalo, where he had read law. But after years of apprenticeships and being under the thumb of older men, the young lawyer must have relished being his own boss, especially in a town where there were no competing attorneys. Late in life, Fillmore would explain that he chose this route because he lacked the self-confidence to practice in Buffalo.</p> <p>This insecurity reflected his impoverished youth, poor education, and the status decline of his family when they lost their land. He was a poor boy from the sticks. His father was an unsuccessful farmer. He had only a year or two of formal education beyond the rudimentary elementary schools of Cayuga County. He was well read and always striving to appear better read, but his education lacked any intellectual rigor. Throughout his life he was a consumer of books so that he could constantly educate himself. He was always impeccably dressed&#x2014;perhaps the sign of a pretender trying to convince those around him that he actually belonged in polite society. He was, and always would be, cautious and conservative in his demeanor and style. Even in his personal life he must have been plagued by insecurities. It is true that he was a very handsome young man, but he was in love with a beautiful woman who came from a prominent, well-educated, and comparatively sophisticated family. He was the son of a dirt farmer, a self-educated factory apprentice who had somehow become a lawyer.</p> <p>In many ways Fillmore's life mirrors that of the other famous frontier president of this period, Abraham Lincoln. Both were from poor farm families, were largely self-educated, and became successful lawyers. But their differences and their ideological developments are more important than their similarities. As a boy Fillmore attended local public schools while working on the farm and found time to gain more education while apprenticed at the mill. His father wanted him to succeed, supported his educational strivings, found him his first law clerkship, and encouraged him all along the way. Fillmore had a loving and apparently emotionally comfortable home with two supportive parents. It was a home he could return to throughout his youth and young adulthood, even after he was admitted to the bar. In contrast, Lincoln's mother died when he was a child, and he had to struggle against a tyrannical father to gain an education. Growing up in rural Kentucky and Indiana, he had virtually no formal schooling, and his father discouraged him from getting any. Lincoln's father thought reading was a waste of time and a sign of laziness. While Fillmore returned home after being admitted to the bar, Lincoln could not wait to leave home at age twenty-one, and once gone he never looked back.</p> <p>The relationship of both men to politics is also revealing. Lincoln&#x2014;a "little engine of ambition," as his law partner William Herndon called him&#x2014;was always engaged in politics. He ran for public office before he married, secured a profession, or had a steady income. He became a lawyer after he was elected to office, and while his legal career made him economically comfortable, politics motivated him. Fillmore's approach to law and politics&#x2014;and to life itself&#x2014;was more plodding. He came to politics opportunistically, almost by accident, rather than by design. He might have happily remained a successful lawyer and civic leader in Buffalo. Lincoln hungered for more.</p> <p>Equally intriguing is the contrast in their striving for social success and acceptability. The well-dressed Fillmore was perpetually conscious of his manners and public persona. He was a parvenu who seemed always worried that someone might discover he did not belong in proper society. He changed churches as he became more successful and moved to bigger and better houses. Outward appearances truly mattered to him. Lincoln was a rawboned frontier lawyer and politician. Until he ran for president, he showed little interest in his clothing or his appearance. Ambitious as he was, he did not pretend to be pious and was never a churchgoer. Lincoln was famous for his sense of humor and his ribald jokes. It is impossible to imagine the dour Fillmore telling a joke, much less an off-color one.</p> <p>Both men were Whigs, and both were devoted to the Union and the Constitution. But Fillmore was drawn to oddball political movements, conspiracy theories, and ethnic hatred. Whether opportunistically or out of conviction, Fillmore launched his political career as an Anti-Mason in the 1820s. When the Anti-Masonic movement ran its course, he became a traditional Whig but easily trafficked with anti-Catholic and anti-immigrant groups. Significantly, Fillmore's rivals in the New York Whig Party, William H. Seward and Thurlow Weed, opposed any bargain with the nativists because it would simultaneously "weaken the party's integrity and alienate immigrants."5 Fillmore was always comfortable with nativists and utter...</p></p><h2>Extinction: A Novel (Vintage International)</h2><p>The last work of fiction by one of the twentieth century&#x2019;s greatest artists, <i>Extinction </i>is widely considered Thomas Bernhard&#x2019;s magnum opus.<br>&nbsp;<br>Franz-Josef Murau&#x2014;the intellectual black sheep of a powerful Austrian land-owning family&#x2014;lives in Rome in self-imposed exile, surrounded by a coterie of artistic and intellectual friends.

When she's not writing, Susan directs the Small Groups and Connection Ministries program at her San Diego church.</p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bride stood in a circle of Virginia sunlight, her narrow heels clicking on Holly Oak&#x2019;s patio stones as she greeted strangers in the receiving line. Her wedding dress was a simple A-line, strapless, with a gauzy skirt of white that breezed about her knees like lacy curtains at an open window. She had pulled her unveiled brunette curls into a loose arrangement dotted with tiny flowers that she&#x2019;d kept alive on her flight from Phoenix. Her only jewelry was a white topaz pendant at her throat and the band of platinum on her left ring finger. Tall, slender, and tanned from the famed and relentless Arizona sun, hers was a girl-nextdoor look: pretty but not quite beautiful. Adelaide thought it odd that Marielle held no bouquet.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the parlor window Adelaide watched as her grandson-in-law, resplendent in a black tuxedo next to his bride, bent toward the guests and greeted them by name, saying, &#x201c;This is Marielle.&#x201d; An explanation seemed ready to spring from his lips each time he shook the hand of someone who had known Sara, her deceased granddaughter. His first wife. Carson stood inches from Marielle, touching her elbow every so often, perhaps to assure himself that after four years a widower he had indeed patently and finally moved on from grief.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Smatterings of conversations wafted about on the May breeze and into the parlor as received guests strolled toward trays of sweet tea and champagne. Adelaide heard snippets from her place at the window. Hudson and Brette, her great-grandchildren, had moved away from the snaking line of gray suits and pastel dresses within minutes of the first guests&#x2019; arrival and were now studying the flower-festooned gift table under the window ledge, touching the bows, fingering the silvery white wrappings. Above the children, an old oak&#x2019;s youngest branches shimmied to the tunes a string quartet produced from the gazebo beyond the receiving line.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adelaide raised a teacup to her lips and sipped the last of its contents, allowing the lemony warmth to linger at the back of her throat. She had spent the better part of the morning readying the garden for Carson and Marielle&#x2019;s wedding reception, plucking spent geranium blossoms, ordering the catering staff about, and straightening the rented linen tablecloths. She needed to join the party now that it had begun. The Blue-Haired Old Ladies would be wondering where she was.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her friends had been the first to arrive, coming through the garden gate on the south side of the house at five minutes before the hour. She&#x2019;d watched as Carson introduced them to Marielle, witnessed how they cocked their necks in blue-headed unison to sweetly scrutinize her grandson-in-law&#x2019;s new wife, and heard their welcoming remarks through the open window.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deloris gushed about how lovely Marielle&#x2019;s wedding dress was and what, pray tell, was the name of that divine purple flower she had in her hair?<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pearl invited Marielle to her bridge club next Tuesday afternoon and asked her if she believed in ghosts.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maxine asked her how Carson and she had met&#x2014;though Adelaide had told her weeks ago that Carson met Marielle on the Internet&#x2014;and why on earth Arizona didn&#x2019;t like daylight-saving time.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Marielle had smiled, sweet and knowing&#x2014;like the kindergarten teacher who finds the bluntness of five-year-olds endearing&#x2014;and answered the many questions.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mojave asters. She didn&#x2019;t know how to play bridge. She&#x2019;d never encountered a ghost so she couldn&#x2019;t really say but most likely not. She and Carson met online. There&#x2019;s no need to save what one has an abundance of. Carson had cupped her elbow in his hand, and his thumb caressed the inside of her arm while she spoke.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adelaide swiftly set the cup down on the table by the window, whisking away the remembered tenderness of that same caress on Sara&#x2019;s arm.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carson had every right to remarry.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sara had been dead for four years.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She turned from the bridal tableau outside and inhaled deeply the gardenia-scented air in the parlor. Unbidden thoughts of her granddaughter sitting with her in that very room gently nudged her. Sara at six cutting out paper dolls. Memorizing multiplication tables at age eight. Sewing brass buttons onto gray wool coats at eleven. Sara reciting a poem for English Lit at sixteen, comparing college acceptance letters at eighteen, sharing a chance letter from her estranged mother at nineteen, showing Adelaide her engagement ring at twenty-four. Coming back home to Holly Oak with Carson when Hudson was born. Nursing Brette in that armchair by the fireplace. Leaning against the door frame and telling Adelaide&nbsp;that she was expecting her third child.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right there Sara had done those things while Adelaide sat at the long table in the center of the room, empty now but usually awash in yards of stiff Confederate gray, glistening gold braid, and tiny piles of brass buttons&#x2014;the shining elements of officer reenactment uniforms before they see war.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adelaide ran her fingers along the table&#x2019;s polished surface, the warm wood as old as the house itself. Carson had come to her just a few months ago while she sat at that table piecing together a sharpshooter&#x2019;s forest green jacket. He had taken a chair across from her as Adelaide pinned a collar, and he&#x2019;d said he needed to tell her something.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He&#x2019;d met someone.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When she&#x2019;d said nothing, he added, &#x201c;It&#x2019;s been four years, Adelaide.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;I know how long it&#x2019;s been.&#x201d; The pins made a tiny plucking sound as their pointed ends pricked the fabric.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;She lives in Phoenix.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;You&#x2019;ve never been to Phoenix.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;Mimi.&#x201d; He said the name Sara had given her gently, as a father might. A tender reprimand. He waited until she looked up at him. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think Sara would want me to live the rest of my life alone. I really don&#x2019;t. And I don&#x2019;t think she would want Hudson and Brette not to have a mother.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;Those children have a mother.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;You know what I mean. They need to be mothered. I&#x2019;m gone all day at work. I only have the weekends with them. And you won&#x2019;t always be here. You&#x2019;re a wonderful great-grandmother, but they need someone to mother them, Mimi.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She pulled the pin cushion closer to her and swallowed. &#x201c;I know they do.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He leaned forward in his chair. &#x201c;And I...I miss having someone to share my life with. I miss the companionship. I miss being in love. I miss having someone love me.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adelaide smoothed the pieces of the collar. &#x201c;So. You are in love?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He had taken a moment to answer. &#x201c;Yes. I think I am.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carson hadn&#x2019;t brought anyone home to the house, and he hadn&#x2019;t been on any dates. But he had lately spent many nights after the children were in bed in his study&#x2014;the old drawing room&#x2014;with the door closed. When she&#x2019;d pass by, Adelaide would hear the low bass notes of his voice as he spoke softly into his phone. She knew that gentle sound. She had heard it before, years ago when Sara and Carson would sit in the study and talk about their day. His voice, deep and resonant. Hers, soft and melodic.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;Are you going to marry her?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carson had laughed. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t you even want to know her name?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She had not cared at that moment about a name. The specter of being alone in Holly Oak shoved itself forward in her mind. If he remarried, he&#x2019;d likely move out and take the children with him. &#x201c;Are you taking the children? Are you leaving Holly Oak?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;Adelaide&#x2014;&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;Will you be leaving?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several seconds of silence had hung suspended between them. Carson and Sara had moved into Holly Oak ten years earlier to care for Adelaide after heart surgery and had simply stayed. Ownership of Holly Oak had been Sara&#x2019;s birthright and was now Hudson and Brette&#x2019;s future inheritance. Carson stayed on after Sara died because, in her grief, Adelaide asked him to, and in his grief, Carson said yes.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;Will you be leaving?&#x201d; she asked again.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;Would you want me to leave?&#x201d; He sounded unsure.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;You would stay?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carson had sat back in his chair. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know if it&#x2019;s a good idea to take Hudson and Brette out of the only home they&#x2019;ve known. They&#x2019;ve already had to deal with more than any kid should.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;So you would marry this woman and bring her here. To this house.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carson had hesitated only a moment. &#x201c;Yes.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She knew without asking that they were not talking solely about the effects moving would have on a ten-year-old boy and a six-year-old girl. They were talking about the strange biology of their grief. Sara had been taken from them both, and Holly Oak nurtured their common sorrow in the most kind and savage of ways. Happy memories were one way of keeping someone attached to a house and its people. Grief was the other. Surely Carson knew this. An inner nudging prompted her to consider asking him what his new bride would want.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;What is her name?&#x201d; she asked instead.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he answered, &#x201c;Marielle...&#x201d;</p><h2>The Pity Of War: Explaining World War I</h2><p><b>From a bestselling historian, a daringly revisionist history of World War I</b><br><i>The Pity of War </i>makes a simple and provocative argument: the human atrocity known as the Great War was entirely England's fault. According to Niall Ferguson, England entered into war based on naive assumptions of German aims, thereby transforming a Continental conflict into a world war, which it then badly mishandled, necessitating American involvement. The war was not inevitable, Ferguson argues, but rather was the result of the mistaken decisions of individuals who would later claim to have been in the grip of huge impersonal forces.<br>That the war was wicked, horrific, and inhuman is memorialized in part by the poetry of men like Wilfred Owen and Siegfried Sassoon, but also by cold statistics. Indeed, more British soldiers were killed in the first day of the Battle of the Somme than Americans in the Vietnam War. And yet, as Ferguson writes, while the war itself was a disastrous folly, the great majority of men who fought it did so with little reluctance and with some enthusiasm. For anyone wanting to understand why wars are fought, why men are willing to fight them and why the world is as it is today, there is no sharper or more stimulating guide than Niall Ferguson's <i>The Pity of War</i>.</p><p>If someone less distinguished than Jesus College, Oxford, fellow Niall Ferguson had written <i>The Pity of War</i>, you could be forgiven for thinking the book was out for a few cheap headlines by contradicting almost every accepted orthodoxy about the First World War. Ferguson argues that Britain was as much to blame for the start of the war as Germany, and that, had Britain sacrificed Belgium to Germany, the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution would never have happened. Germany, he continues, would have created a united European state, and Britain could have remained a superpower. He also contends that there was little enthusiasm for the war in Britain in 1914; on the other hand, he claims the war was prolonged not by clever manipulation of the media, but by British soldiers' taking pleasure in combat. If that isn't enough, he further maintains that it wasn't the severity of the conditions imposed on Germany at Versailles in 1919 that led inexorably to World War II, and blames instead the comparative leniency and the failure to collect reparations in full.<p> <i>The Pity of War</i>, with no pretensions to offering a grand narrative of the war, goes over its chosen questions like a polemical tract. As such it is immensely readable, well researched, and controversial. You may not end up agreeing with all of Ferguson's arguments, but that should not deter you from reading it. All of us need our deeply held views challenged from time to time, even if only to remind us why we've got them. <i>--John Crace, Amazon.co.uk</i></p>Praise for this title <p>"I know of no other account of the First World War that does such a convincing job of explaining the war and bringing its grim realities to life." --David Clay Large, author of Where Ghosts Walked: Munich's Road to the Third Reich </p><p>"Innovative and imaginative (in the best sense), this bold reassessment of World War I asks questions that are too rarely asked - including what may be most anguishing of all: Did the war have to be a world war?

Seafloors forced high into the sky. Fossils of a long-extinct, 385-pound flightless bird that roamed subtropical floodplains. From the crest of the Cascades to the Pacific, and from the Columbia River north to the Canadian border, the ghosts of deep time are widely exposed in western Washington. But geology never really dies. It is very much active and alive in the region: volcanoes periodically erupt, showering their surroundings with ash; earthquakes shake Earth&#x2019;s surface and the constructions of humans, sending tsunamis ashore to wreak havoc; and melting alpine glaciers send forth great floods of water.<br>In <i>Geology Underfoot in Western Washington</i>, the most recent addition to the Geology Underfoot series, author and geoscientist Dave Tucker narrates western Washington&#x2019;s geologic tales, covering sites from it&#x2019;s low-lying shorelines to its rugged mountaintops. The book&#x2019;s 22 chapters, or vignettes, lead you to easily accessible stops along Washington&#x2019;s highways&#x2015;and some trails, too. A healthy dose of full-color illustrations and photos compliments the author&#x2019;s illuminating prose, further demystifying Washington&#x2019;s geologic wonders.

He counseled readers to "study death always," and took his own advice, returning to the subject again and again in all his writings, yet he never treated it in a complete work. <i>How to Die</i> gathers in one volume, for the first time, Seneca's remarkable meditations on death and dying. Edited and translated by James S. Romm, <i>How to Die</i> reveals a provocative thinker and dazzling writer who speaks with a startling frankness about the need to accept death or even, under certain conditions, to seek it out. </p><p>Seneca believed that life is only a journey toward death and that one must rehearse for death throughout life.

During one at-bat this talented slugger lined a ball so hard that the rightfielder was able to play it off the top of the fence and throw Christobel Torrienti out at first base. The scout liked what he saw, but was disappointed in the player's appearance. "He was a light brown," recalled one of Torrienti's teammates, "and would have gone up to the major leagues, but he had real rough hair." Such was life behind the color line, the unofficial boundary that prevented hundreds of star-quality athletes from playing big-league baseball.<br><br>When <em>Only the Ball Was White</em> was first published in 1970, Satchel Paige had not yet been inducted into the Hall of Fame and there was a general ignorance even among sports enthusiasts of the rich tradition of the Negro Leagues. Few knew that during the 1930s and '40s outstanding black teams were playing regularly in Yankee Stadium and Brooklyn's Ebbets Field. And names like Cool Papa Bell, Rube Foster, Judy Johnson, Biz Mackey, and Buck Leonard would bring no flash of smiling recognition to the fan's face, even though many of these men could easily have played alongside Ty Cobb, Walter Johnson, Hack Wilson, Lou Gehrig--and shattered their records in the process. Many baseball pundits now believe, for example, that had Josh Gibson played in the major leagues, he would have surpassed Babe Ruth's 714 home runs before Hank Aaron had even hit his first. And the great Dizzy Dean acknowledged that the best pitcher he had ever seen was not Lefty Grove or Carl Hubbell, but rather "old Satchel Paige, that big lanky colored boy."<br><br>In <em>Only the Ball Was White</em>, Robert Peterson tells the forgotten story of these excluded ballplayers, and gives them the recognition they were so long denied. Reconstructing the old Negro Leagues from contemporary sports publications, accounts of games in the black press, and through interviews with the men who actually played the game, Peterson brings to life the fascinating period that stretched from shortly after the Civil War to the signing of Jackie Robinson in 1947. We watch as the New York Black Yankees and the Philadelphia Crawfords take the field, look on as the East-West All-Star lineups are announced, and listen as the players themselves tell of the struggle and glory that was black baseball. In addition to these vivid accounts, Peterson includes yearly Negro League standings and an all-time register of players and officials, making the book a treasure trove of baseball information and lore.<br><br>A monumental and poignant book, <em>Only the Ball Was White</em> reminds us that what was often considered the "Golden Age" of baseball was also the era of Jim Crow. It is a book that must be read by anyone hoping not only to understand the story of baseball, but the story of America.<br></p><p><br><strong>Robert W. Peterson</strong> is the author of <em>Cages to Jump Shots</em> (Oxford, 1990) and <em>The Boy Scouts: An American Adventure</em>. He has written for <em>Sports Illustrated, The New York Times Magazine, Sport, Boys' Life</em>, and many other magazines.<br><br>"[A] thorough, well-documented book....A worthy and fascinating addition to anyone's baseball library."--<em>The New York Times Book Review</em><p></p><br>"Peterson...[is] to be congratulated not only for an original subject but an excellent book for anyone who enjoys reading baseball history."--<em>The Sporting News</em><p></p><br>"Filled with the fascination that comes from discovering an unknown, complex, forgotten continent."--<em>Newsweek</em><p></p><br>"Fascinating....One of the truly important sociological contributions to the growing literature of baseball."--<em>The Washington Post Book World</em><p></p><br>"Highly recommended."--<em>Library Journal</em><p></p><br></p><h2>Kant&#39;s Transcendental Idealism: An Interpretation and Defense</h2><p>This landmark book is now reissued in a new edition that has been vastly rewritten and updated to respond to recent Kantian literature.

Vollmann on the ideologies of energy production and the causes of climate change</b><br><br>The second volume of William T. Vollmann's epic book about the factors and human actions that have led to global warming begins in the coal fields of West Virginia and Eastern Kentucky, where "America's best friend" is not merely a fuel, but a "heritage." Over the course of four years Vollmann finds hollowed out towns with coal-polluted streams and acidified drinking water; makes covert visits to mountaintop removal mines; and offers documented accounts of unpaid fines for federal health and safety violations and of miners who died because their bosses cut corners to make more money.<br><br>To write about natural gas, Vollmann journeys to Greeley, Colorado, where he interviews anti-fracking activists, a city planner, and a homeowner with serious health issues from fracking. Turning to oil production, he speaks with, among others, the former CEO of Conoco and a vice president of the Bank of Oklahoma in charge of energy loans, and conducts furtive roadside interviews of guest workers performing oil-related contract labor in the United Arab Emirates.<br><br>As with its predecessor, <i>No Immediate Danger</i>, this volume seeks to understand and listen, not to lay blame--except in a few corporate and political cases where outrage is clearly due. Vollmann is a carbon burner just like the rest of us; he describes and quantifies his own power use, then looks around him, trying to explain to the future why it was that we went against scientific consensus, continually increasing the demand for electric power and insisting that we had no good alternative.</p><p>William T. Vollmann is the author of ten novels, including <i>Europe Central</i>, which won the National Book Award. He has also written four collections of stories, including <i>The Atlas</i>, which won the PEN Center USA Award for fiction, a memoir, and six works of nonfiction, including <i>Rising Up and Rising Down</i> and <i>Imperial</i>, both of which were finalists for the National Book Critics Circle Award. His journalism and fiction have been published in<i> </i>the<i> New Yorker, Harpers, Esquire, Granta</i>, and many other publications.What Should Be Measured?<br><br>. . . wherefore the best means that I could imagine to wake him out of his trance was to cry loud in his ear 'Hough host! What's to pay? Will no man look to the reckoning here?'<br><br>Thomas Nashe, The Unfortunate Traveller, 1594<br><br>In a boggy meadow a few paces to the side of a former logging road in West Virginia, a pipe assemblage crouched hissing. Bubbles rushed up from the pool from which rose one of its tubular columns; there was a reek of natural gas, and from the side of that pipe came a steady outrush of gas, comparable in force to the jet of compressed air from a motorized tire pump, which when I was alive could blow a penny across a parking lot. Since methane is a primary constituent of natural gas, I suspect there was methane in this petrochemical breeze that gushed so continually from the ground, the product of negligent waste. Until meeting the retired mining inspector Stanley Sturgill I used to believe that what I smelled in places such as this was methane, which actually bears no odor; the odor is crude oil.-In its first 20 years, methane, as you may recall, is at least 86 times more effective at trapping heat than carbon dioxide. The environmental activist who was guiding us here remarked that he had already informed the state Department of Environmental Protection of this gas rig's ongoing crime. Of course nothing was done, here and for all I knew in thousands and millions of other sites.<br><br>Holding the pancake frisker directly in the gas jet, I took a one-minute timed count, and obtained a reading of 15 counts per minute, 0.06 microsieverts per hour-the lowest I had ever obtained in West Virginia, and indeed pretty close to the lowest possible measurement.<br><br>Coal-fired power plants give off poisonous emissions, and some of them are even said to be radioactive-which my superficial measurements never found to be so. The air dose by the John E. Amos Power Plant in Nitro, West Virginia (this I measured by poking the frisker out the window of a moving vehicle, a procedure which should have increased the number of encountered particles), was a trifling 39 counts per minute, 0.12 micros per hour. (I did not dig in the ground or frisk anybody's tomatoes.)<br><br>In order to accurately inform you to what extent the four modes of resource extraction and utilization considered in Carbon Ideologies were or were not harmful, I would have needed to measure at least the following: carbon dioxide, methane, chlorinated fluorocarbons, aerial particulate sizes, concentrations and compositions; acidity, turbidity, conductivity and metal content of water, the latter subcategorized into selenium, cadmium, aluminum, etcetera; I also ought to have sampled the density of specific microorganisms, amphibians and crustaceans. Accomplishing this was impossible for me, and I am sorry. At a manageable price I could indeed have bought a meter to monitor certain emissions such as carbon dioxide, but the salesman sadly explained that because those gases mix so instantaneously with air, a useful measurement could only have been obtained right up on the smokestack-from which I was fenced out by the so-called regulated community.<br><br>That environmental activist in West Virginia (his name was Chad Cordell) had a device to sample water for pH and conductivity; maybe I should have bought one of those. But more often than not, I found myself in waterless places.<br><br>So please consider the pancake frisker readings in the remainder of this book as placeholders for the measurements that I would have taken had I possessed more money and power.<br><br>Perhaps it was just as well. My readings in the red zones scored sufficient drama in their way; and only one variable-radioactivity-needed to be considered. The manifold effects of fracking, coal-burning, oil refining and kindred operations augmented one other variable of yet more crucial interest: the warming of our planetary home. Since I could frisk neither a smokestack nor a barrel of oil for greenhouse emissions, there was nothing for it but to let this book grow inchoate. I could hint at the villainous parts played by this heavy metal and that gas; there were so many villains! I could portray well-meaning ignorance, mercenary dishonesty and ruthlessness, indifference, useless heroism and sensible accommodation. Among the tales of coal and oil and natural gas I never heard of accidents comparable to the reactor failures at Fukushima. What then could my narratives be?<br><br>Although they do not speak directly to climate change, I ask you to consider the preceding nuclear section as a concentrated relation of this book's theme, which runs like this:<br><br>Once upon a time there was something dangerous that could not be seen, felt, heard or smelled. ("Because it's invisible . . . ," sighed my Japanese taxi drivers.) Making use of its associated fuel had been convenient, but terribly mistaken. The best plan would have been to get away from this nearly unknowable thing, but such a course of action appeared so utterly inconvenient that we preferred to continue on as before, which might entail killing our children. Then again, maybe our children would be lucky enough to die from their own stupidity instead of ours. As The Wall Street Journal reminded us, I think by way of reassurance:<br><br>It's easy enough to drive out to the country and find somebody in overalls willing to blame the latest flood, drought, windstorm or six-legged pest outbreak on the increased carbon in the atmosphere.<br><br>About Permissible Limits<br><br>For every human presupposition and every enunciation has as much authority as another, unless reason shows the difference between them.<br><br>Montaigne, "Apology for Raymond Sebond," 1575-80<br><br>Assuming that our generation had in fact been able and willing to measure, record and publicly share local and planetary levels of hydrofluorocarbons, nitrous oxides, carbon dioxide and all those other invisible analogues of radiocontamination, the next step, which would have been more contentious, must have been to establish legal ceilings for each, along with procedures for addressing violations.<br><br>A few pages earlier I compared Japan's and Ukraine's statutory limits for cesium-137 in various foods. Their variability of categorizations, as in the case of milk, did not entirely obscure consistent ways of thinking. For example, the Ukrainian allowance for higher radioactivity in dried than in fresh foods presumably derived from a supposition that before consumption the dried items would get rehydrated in a significant bulk of (I hope less radioactive) liquid; therefore, one would ingest a smaller quantity of dried than fresh milk, even if the respective liquid volumes were the same. This is arguable, but plausible. And although the Ukrainian allowance of 2,500 becquerels per kilo for dried berries did seem awfully lenient, in fact the two nations' chains of reasoning ran somewhat parallel:<br><br>AQ: "a few pages earlier" is in Vol. I. Recast?<br><br>The Ministry of Health of Ukraine had set its standards based on the fact that the content of Cs-137 and Sr-90 in food and drinking water should respect the accepted boundaries of the annual effective exposure of 1 mSv. And the Japanese Ministry of the Environment had likewise said: To achieve further food safety and consumer confidence, Japan is planning to reduce [the] maximum permissible dose from 5 mSv/year to 1 mSv/year.<br><br>Yes, permissible limits would inevitably be arbitrary, like speed limits, felony charges and rules of war, but that alone could not invalidate them, because the lack of limits was more perilous.<br><br>And we needed to draft them for greenhouse gases. In addition to that annual per capita food radiation limit of 1 millisievert, we should have established annual per person emissions ceilings for, at the very least, the dozen most pernicious heat-trapping agents (doubtless you from the future have a longer retrospective wish list).-But that whatever those ceilings were, we would have hated them as infringements of our freedoms. And so when I was alive we wasted years arguing about national and international carbon budgets. It was as if Japan and Ukraine had agreed to disagree as to whether they needed to safeguard their citizens against unregulated intake of cesium-137.<br><br>AQ: Delete that?<br><br>That was one reason we kept burning and selling coal when I was alive.<br><br>COAL<br><br>West Virginia, U.S.A.

Set in fourteenth-century Norway, <i>The Wreath</i>, the first volume of Undset&#x2019;s medieval trilogy begins the life story of Kristin Lavransdatter. Starting with Kristin&#x2019;s childhood and continuing through her romance with Erlend Nikulauss�n, a dangerously charming and impetuous man, Undset re-creates the historical backdrop in vivid detail, immersing readers in the day-to-day life, social conventions, and political undercurrents of the period. But the story she tells is a modern one, brought to life with clarity and lyrical beauty in this remarkable translation by Tiina Nunnally.&nbsp; Defying her parents and stubbornly pursuing her own happiness, Kristin emerges as a woman who loves with power and passion.</p><p>Originally published in Norwegian in 1920 and set in fourteenth-century Norway, The Wreath chronicles the courtship of a headstrong and passionate young woman and a dangerously charming and impetuous man. Undset re-creates the historical backdrop in vivid detail, immersing readers in the day-to-day life, social conventions, and political undercurrents of the period. Her prose combines the sounds and style of Nordic ballads, European courtly poetry, and religious literature. But the story Undset tells is a modern one; it mirrors post-World War I political and religious anxieties, and introduces a heroine who has long captivated contemporary readers. Defying her parents and stubbornly pursuing her own happiness, Kristin emerges as a woman who not only loves with power and passion but intrepidly confronts her sexuality.<b>Sigrid Undset</b> (1882-1949) was born in Denmark, the eldest daughter of a Norwegian father and a Danish mother. Two years after her birth, the family moved to Oslo, where her father, a distinguished archaeologist, taught at the university. Her father's interest in the past had a tremendous influence on Undset. She was particularly entranced by the dramatic Old Norse sagas she read as a child, later declaring that her exposure to them marked "the most important turning point in my life."<p>Undset's first published works&#x2014;the novel <i>Mrs. Marta Oulie</i> (1907) and a short-story collection <i>The Happy Age</i> (1908)&#x2014;were set in contemporary times and achieved both critical and popular success. With her reputation as a writer well-established, Undset had the freedom to explore the world that had first fired her imagination, and in <i>Gunnar's Daughter</i> (1909) she drew upon her knowledge of Norway's history and legends, including the Icelandic Sagas, to recreate medieval life with compelling immediacy. In 1912 Undset married the painter Anders Castus Svarstad and over the next ten years faced the formidable challenge of raising three stepchildren and her own three off-spring with little financial or emotional support from her husband. Eventually, she and her children moved from Oslo to Lillehammer, and her marriage was annulled in 1924, when Undset converted to Catholicism.</p><p>Although Undset wrote more modern novels, a collection of essays on feminism, as well as numerous book reviews and newspaper articles, her fascination with the Middle Ages never ebbed, and in 1920 she published <i>The Wreath</i>, the first volume of her most famous work, <i>Kristin Lavransdatter</i>. The next two volumes quickly followed&#x2014;<i>The Wife</i> in 1921, and <i>The Cross</i> in 1922. The trilogy earned Undset worldwide acclaim, and her second great medieval epic&#x2014;the four-volume <i>The Master of Hestviken</i> (1925-1927) &#x2014;confirmed her place as one of the twentieth century's greatest writers. In 1928, at the age of 46, she received the Nobel Prize for Literature, only the third woman to be so honored.</p><p>Undset went on to publish more novels&#x2014;including the autobiographical <i>The Longest Years</i>&#x2014;and several collections of essays during the 1930s. As the Germans advanced through Norway in 1940, Undset, an outspoken critic of Nazism, fled the country and eventually settled in Brooklyn, New York. She returned to her homeland in 1945, and two years later she was awarded Norway's highest honor for her "distinguished literary work and for service to her country." The years of exile, however, had taken a great toll on her, and she died of a stroke on June 10, 1949.<br><br><b>Tiina Nunnally </b>is an award-winning translator of Danish, Norwegian, and Swedish. Her translation of&nbsp;<i>Kristin Lavransdatter III: The Cross</i>&nbsp;by Sigrid Undset won the PEN/Book-of-the-Month Club Translation Prize in 2001, and her translation of Peter H�eg's&nbsp;<i>Smilla's Sense of Snow</i>&nbsp;won the American Translator's Association's Lewis Galanti�re Prize.

Therefore, adults administer common disciplinary approaches based on rewards and punishment in an effort to control students. However, research demonstrates that unless children are taught social and emotional skills, they have a tough time learning, and discipline problems increase.<br><br> Positive Discipline is a different approach. Picture a train trying to reach its destination on one track. It can&#x2019;t be done. The train needs two tracks, and so do our schools. The first track is academics, and the second track is social and emotional development. Positive Discipline consists of methods that involve students in focusing on solutions instead of being the recipients of punishments and rewards. Schools that have used this integrated system (both tracks side by side) report that behavior challenges decrease and academic excellence increases. The following photo, used with permission from the Visalia, California, School District, illustrates what they refer to as &#x201c;A Climate for Learning.&#x201d;<br><br> Years ago one of the authors was struggling to learn how to use a �computer&#x2014;�she wondered if it was worth all the effort. Then she heard someone say, &#x201c;It&#x2019;s too late to decide whether there should be an electronic train. The choice now is when to jump on the train.&#x201d; His words have echoed in her mind as one new electronic development has followed another. Her world is filled with electronics that make her life easier and more interesting. She&#x2019;s glad she jumped on the train. Now that you&#x2019;ve been introduced to the two tracks of Positive Discipline, we hope you&#x2019;ll want to jump on that train.<br><br> Before you shake your head and say, &#x201c;No way! I can&#x2019;t handle one more thing in my already busy classroom,&#x201d; we hope you&#x2019;ll consider this: Positive Discipline will make your life easier. �Really! If you&#x2019;re a kind and firm teacher who focuses on academics along with teaching social and emotional skills, you&#x2019;re already on board. If you&#x2019;re wondering if a Positive Discipline classroom is the direction you&#x2019;d like to go, here are some questions for you to consider.<br><br> 1.Do you want your students to be good decision makers?<br><br> 2.Do you want your students to learn resilience?<br><br> 3.Do you want your students to learn responsibility �(response-�ability)?<br><br> 4.Do you want your students to learn cooperation?<br><br> 5.Do you want your students to learn listening skills?<br><br> 6.Do you want your students to learn to use �self-�control?<br><br> 7.Do you want your students to learn to be comfortable with accountability?<br><br> 8.Do you want to provide a forum where others can say how they were affected by hurtful behavior?<br><br> 9.Do you want to help students learn how to make amends for the mistakes that hurt others?<br><br> 10.Do you want a classroom where students are learning the qualities and strengths for good character?<br><br> 11.Do you want a classroom where academic excellence can happen because students are encouraged to love learning?<br><br> Positive Discipline&#x2013;trained teachers create classrooms where young people are treated with respect, have the courage and excitement to love learning, and have the opportunity to learn the skills they need for a successful life. The Positive Discipline vision is about schools&nbsp; where children never experience humiliation when they fail but in- stead feel empowered by the opportunity to learn from their mistakes in a safe environment. Many of the social and emotional skills students learn are represented in the Significant Seven Perceptions and Skills.<br><br> Three Empowering Beliefs That Help Children Succeed&nbsp; in School and in Life<br><br> 1.I am capable.<br><br> 2.I contribute in meaningful ways, and I am genuinely&nbsp; needed.<br><br> 3.I use my personal power to make choices that positively influence what happens to me and my community.<br><br> Four Empowering Skills That Help Children Succeed&nbsp; in School and in Life<br><br> 1.I have discipline and �self-�control.<br><br> 2.I can work respectfully with others.<br><br> 3.I understand how my behavior affects others.<br><br> 4.I can develop wisdom and judgment skills through daily practice.<br><br> Here is a description of how Positive Discipline methods teach the Significant Seven.<br><br> I Am Capable<br><br> To develop a belief in their own personal capability, young people need a safe climate in which they can explore the consequences of their choices&nbsp; and behavior without judgments about success or �failure&#x2014; �without blame, shame, or pain. Positive Discipline methods provide a safe climate in which students can examine their behavior, discover how it affects others, and engage in effective problem solving to create change.<br><br> I Contribute in Meaningful Ways,&nbsp; and I Am Genuinely Needed<br><br> To develop the belief in their significance in primary relationships, young people need the experience of having others listen to their feelings, thoughts, and ideas and take them seriously. They need to know &#x201c;I am important, and I count.&#x201d; In a Positive Discipline classroom, everyone has the opportunity to voice opinions and make suggestions in an orderly, respectful process. Students learn that they can contribute significantly to the �problem-�solving process and can successfully follow through on chosen suggestions. They experience the primary goal of all �people&#x2014;�a sense of belonging and significance.<br><br> I Use My Personal Power to Make Choices That Positively Influence What Happens to Me and My Community<br><br> Many teachers fail to understand that students have personal power and will use it in one way or another. If they are not given opportunities to use it in productive ways, they will probably use it in destructive ways. Young people, to develop a healthy use of power in their lives, need the opportunity to contribute in useful ways, in an environment that encourages them but also holds them accountable. They need to learn to understand and accept their power to create a positive environment. A Positive Discipline classroom is a place where students can experience that it is okay to make mistakes and to learn from those mistakes. In Class Meetings, they learn to take responsibility for their mistakes (accountability), because instead of being punished, they receive assistance in exploring ways to learn from their mistakes. They also learn that even when they can&#x2019;t control what happens, they can control their response to what happens.<br><br> I Have �Self-�Discipline&nbsp; and �Self-�Control<br><br> A Positive Discipline classroom is an excellent place where students can name and claim their feelings and develop empathy and compassion. Young people seem to be more willing to listen when they are listened to. They gain understanding of their emotions and behaviors by hearing feedback from their classmates. In a nonthreatening climate, young people are willing to be accountable for their actions. They learn what a feeling is and how to separate their feelings from their actions. They learn that what they feel (anger, for instance) is separate from what they do (hit someone), and that although feelings are always acceptable, some actions are not. Through the �problem-�solving process, they learn proactive rather than reactive ways to express or deal with their thoughts or feelings. They develop �self-�discipline and �self-�control by thinking through the consequences of their choices and by accepting suggestions for solutions from other students. The notion of inviting students to explore the consequences of their choices is quite different from imposing a consequence on them, which is usually a poorly disguised punishment. By exploring the consequences of choices, students learn from their mistakes instead of trying to hide them or defend them.<br><br> I Can Work Respectfully with Others<br><br> A Positive Discipline classroom provides the best possible opportunity for young people to develop social skills through dialogue and sharing, listening and empathizing, cooperating, negotiating, and resolving conflicts. When a behavior problem arises, teachers, instead of stepping in and resolving it for the students, can put it on the Class Meeting agenda, or use the Four �Problem-�Solving Steps, or instruct students in the use of the Wheel of Choice. All these methods, discussed in Chapter 7, allow students and teachers to work together on developing �win-�win solutions.<br><br> I Understand How My Behavior&nbsp; Affects Others<br><br> A Positive Discipline classroom is a place where students can respond to the limits and consequences of everyday life with responsibility, resilience, and integrity. They learn that it is safe to take responsibility for their mistakes because they will not experience blame, shame, or pain.

When a problem develops in a Positive Discipline classroom, students explore what happened, what caused it to happen, how their behavior affects others, and what they can do to prevent or solve such problems in the future. In this way, they learn to respond to the needs of the situation.</p><h2>Gardner&#39;s Art Through the Ages</h2><p>The market-leading text for the art history survey course, GARDNER&#39;S ART THROUGH THE AGES has served as a comprehensive and thoughtfully crafted guide to the defining phases of the world&#39;s artistic tradition. With this book in hand, thousands of students have watched the story of art unfold in its full historical, social, religious, economic, and cultural context, and thus deepened their understanding of art, architecture, painting, and sculpture. By virtue of its comprehensive coverage, strong emphasis on context, and rich, accurate art reproductions, GARDNER&#39;S ART THROUGH THE AGES has earned and sustained a reputation of excellence and authority. So much so, that in 2001, the Text and Academic Authors Association awarded both the McGuffey and the &#34;Texty&#34; Book Prizes to the Eleventh Edition of the text. It is the first art history book to win either award and the only title ever to win both prizes in one year. The Twelfth Edition maintains and exceeds the richness of the Gardner legacy with updated research and scholarship and an even more beautiful art program featuring more color images than any other art history book available. The Twelfth Edition features such enhancements as more color photographs, a stunning new design, and the most current research and scholarship. What&#39;s more, the expanded ancillary package that accompanies GARDNER&#39;S ART THROUGH THE AGES, features a wealth of tools to enhance your students&#39; experience in the course. With each new copy of the book, students receive a copy of the ArtStudy 2.0 CD-ROM--an interactive electronic study aid that fully integrates with the Twelfth Edition and includes hundreds of high-quality digital images, plus maps, quizzes, and more.</p><p>Fred S.

In his early twenties he committed himself to literature and avidly read the latest models from England and Europe&#x2014;especially Rousseau, Bage, Godwin, Southey, and Coleridge. By 1795 Brown was earnestly devoted to fiction; once engaged, he composed at a breakneck pace, publishing between 1797 and 1802 seven romances, a long pro-feminist dialogue, and numerous sketches and tales. Four of those romances earned him the perhaps dubious title of "father of the American novel"&#x2014;<i>Wieland</i>&nbsp;(1798),&nbsp;<i>Ormond</i>&nbsp;(1799),&nbsp;<i>Arthur Mervyn</i>&nbsp;(Part 1, 1799; Part II, 1800), and between those two parts,&nbsp;<i>Edgar Huntly</i>&nbsp;(1799). All four are remarkably sophisticated moral, psychological, and political allegories that burned into the artistic consciousness of Poe, Hawthorne, Fenimore Cooper, and Melville. By the 1820s, a decade after his death, Brown was ranked with Washington Irving and Fenimore Cooper as the embodiment of American literary genius, the first American writer to successfully bridge the gulf between entertainment and art in fiction.<br><br><b>Norman S.

The appendixes are awesome, especially appendix B (Paralegal Associations, Bar Associations that Allow Paralegal Membership, and Related Organizations)which is an excellent reference tool for paralegal students. I emphasize legal research and legal writing in all four of my classes, and the research and writing sections of this book are excellent. It is challenging to teach the skills of legal research and writing to my web students because I cannot take them to the university law library, as I do with my traditional classroom students. This book's sections on legal research and writing are so well organized easy to understand that even distance-learning students can use it to independently practice those skill sets. Each chapter summary really captures the most important aspects of the preceding chapter, and the review questions at the end of each chapter further focuses the reader with regard to the most important chapter content. The exhibits are also awesome - especially exhibit 2.3 (General Observations about Paralegal Work in Different Kinds of Law Offices)."<br><br>"Statsky's text provides essential vocabulary, but focuses more on understanding concepts behind the vocabulary and learning critical-thinking skills. Statsky also provides a lesser, more appropriate, level of information about a much broader range of legal specialties than Currier &amp; Eimermann. Statsky's tone is much more readable and encourages learning over memorizing. The "'Assignments"' are fantastic and can be easily be developed further by instructors. Examples are numerous and make the material much easier to understand.

Readers should be aware that Leech did not produce his illustrations in a manner that they are accustomed to seeing in later books.</p></p><p>In the history of English literature, Charles Dickens's <i>A Christmas Carol</i>, which has been continuously in print since it was first published in the winter of 1843, stands out as the quintessential Christmas story. What makes this charming edition of Dickens's immortal tale so special is the collection of 80 vivid illustrations by Everett Shinn (1876-1953). Shinn, a well-known artist in his time, was a popular illustrator of newspapers and magazines whose work displayed a remarkable affinity for the stories of Charles Dickens, evoking the bustling street life of the mid-1800s. Printed on heavy, cream-colored paper stock, the edges of the pages have been left rough, simulating the way in which the story might have appeared in Dickens's own time. Though countless editions of this classic have been published over the years, this one stands out as particularly beautiful, nostalgic, and evocative of the spirit of Christmas.<p>Traditional cover with this full-color gift edition in a slipcase.</p></p><h2>The Next Step in Guided Reading: Focused Assessments and Targeted Lessons for Helping Every Student Become a Better Reader</h2><p>Focused Assessments and Targeted Lessons for Helping Every Student Become a Better Reader\n\nBy Jan Richardson\n\nTeachers facing the challenge of meeting the diverse reading needs of students will find the structure and tools they need in Jan Richardson&#39;s powerful approach to guided reading.

Stendhal narrates a young aristocrat's adventures in Napoleon's army and in the court of Parma, illuminating in the process the whole cloth of European history. As Balzac wrote, "Never before have the hearts of princes, ministers, courtiers, and women been depicted like this...one sees perfection in every detail."<br><br>With beautiful illustrations by Robert Andrew Parker.</p><p>Officer, diplomat, spy, journalist, and intermittent genius, Marie Henri Beyle employed more than 200 aliases in the course of his crowded career. His most famous moniker, however, was Stendhal, which he affixed to his greatest work, <i>The Charterhouse of Parma</i>. The author spent a mere seven weeks cranking out this marvel in 1838, setting the fictional equivalent of a land-speed record. To be honest, there are occasional signs of haste, during which he clearly bypassed <i>le mot juste</i> in favor of narrative zing. So what? Stendhal at his sloppiest is still wittier, and wiser about human behavior, than just about any writer you could name. No wonder so meticulous a stylist as Paul Val�ry was happy to forgive his sins against French grammar: "We should never be finished with Stendhal. I can think of no greater praise than that."<p> The plot of <i>The Charterhouse of Parma</i> suggests a run-of-the-mill potboiler, complete with court intrigue, military derring-do, and more romance than you can shake a saber at. But Stendhal had an amazing, pre-Freudian grasp of psychology (at least the Gallic variant). More than most of his contemporaries, he understood the incessant jostling of love, sex, fear, and ambition, not to mention our endless capacity for self-deception. No wonder his hero, Fabrizio de Dongo, seems to know everything and nothing about himself. Even under fire at the Battle of Waterloo, the young Fabrizio has a tendency to lose himself in Napoleonic reverie: </p><blockquote>Suddenly everyone galloped off. A few moments later Fabrizio saw, twenty paces ahead, a ploughed field that seemed to be strangely in motion; the furrows were filled with water, and the wet ground that formed their crests was exploding into tiny black fragments flung three or four feet into the air. Fabrizio noticed this odd effect as he passed; then his mind returned to daydreams of the Marshal's glory. He heard a sharp cry beside him: two hussars had fallen, riddled by bullets; and when he turned to look at them, they were already twenty paces behind the escort.</blockquote> The quote above, a famous one, captures something of Stendhal's headlong style. Until now, most English-speaking readers have experienced it via C.K. Scott-Moncrieff's superb 1925 translation. But now Richard Howard has modernized his predecessor's period touches, streamlined some of the fussier locutions, and generally given Stendhal his high-velocity due. The result is a timely version of a timeless masterpiece, which shouldn't need to be updated again until, oh, 2050. Crammed with life, lust, and verbal fireworks, <i>The Charterhouse of Parma</i> demonstrates the real truth of its creator's self-composed epitaph: "He lived. He wrote. He loved." <i>--James Marcus</i>"The Charterhouse of Parma has never sparkled in English with such radiance as it does in Richard Howard's new translation."<br>--Edmund White<br><br>"[A] superb new translation."<br>--Bernard Knox, The New York Review of Books<br><br>"An epic tale of war, love, sex, politics, and religion...an action-packed narrative."<br>--The New Yorker</p><h2>Nineteen Minutes: A Novel</h2><p>In nineteen minutes, you can mow the front lawn, color your hair, watch a third of a hockey game.

In the aftermath, the town's residents must not only seek justice in order to begin healing but also come to terms with the role they played in the tragedy. For them, the lines between truth and fiction, right and wrong, insider and outsider have been obscured forever. Josie Cormier, the teenage daughter of the judge sitting on the case, could be the state's best witness, but she can't remember what happened in front of her own eyes. And as the trial progresses, fault lines between the high school and the adult community begin to show, destroying the closest of friendships and families.<br> <br> <i>Nineteen Minutes</i> is <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author Jodi Picoult's most raw, honest, and important novel yet. Told with the straightforward style for which she has become known, it asks simple questions that have no easy answers: Can your own child become a mystery to you? What does it mean to be different in our society? Is it ever okay for a victim to strike back? And who -- if anyone -- has the right to judge someone else?</p><p>Best known for tackling controversial issues through richly told fictional accounts, Jodi Picoult's 14th novel, <i>Nineteen Minutes</i>, deals with the truth and consequences of a smalltown high-school shooting. Set in Sterling, New Hampshire, Picoult offers reads a glimpse of what would cause a 17-year-old to wake up one day, load his backpack with four guns, and kill nine students and one teacher in the span of nineteen minutes. As with any Picoult novel, the answers are never black and white, and it is her exceptional ability to blur the lines between right and wrong that make this author such a captivating storyteller. <p> On Peter Houghton's first day of kindergarten, he watched helplessly as an older boy ripped his lunch box out of his hands and threw it out the window. From that day on, his life was a series of humiliations, from having his pants pulled down in the cafeteria, to being called a freak at every turn. But can endless bullying justify murder? As Picoult attempts to answer this question, she shows us all sides of the equation, from the ruthless jock who loses his ability to speak after being shot in the head, to the mother who both blames and pities herself for producing what most would call a monster. Surrounding Peter's story is that of Josie Cormier, a former friend whose acceptance into the popular crowd hangs on a string that makes it impossible for her to reconcile her beliefs with her actions. </p><p> At times, <i>Nineteen Minutes</i> can seem tediously stereotypical-- jocks versus nerds, parent versus child, teacher versus student. Part of Picoult's gift is showing us the subtleties of these common dynamics, and the startling effects they often have on the moral landscape. As Peter's mother says at the end of this spellbinding novel, "Everyone would remember Peter for nineteen minutes of his life, but what about the other nine million?" --<i>Gisele Toueg</i></p>Jodi Picoult received an AB in creative writing from Princeton and a master&#x2019;s degree in education from Harvard.

Time is a central concern for Proust, appearing first in the title and last as the final word of the novel. What is his vision of the past? Does he have a vision of the present? The future? Can the Narrator be said to be living in the past? Is he like the White Queen in Through the Looking-Glass , with &#39;jam tomorrow and jam yesterday - but never jam today&#39;? 2. The renowned translator of Proust, C. K. Scott Moncrieff, originally grouped the opening section of In Search of Lost Time under the title &#39;The Overture,&#39; which includes two famous passages, the good night kiss and the evocative taste of the madeleine. Does this seem apt? If so, how might this fifty-odd page beginning prefigure what will transpire later? What would you expect to follow, given that an overture usually introduces the main themes of a musical work? What does it suggest about Proust&#39;s conception of literature and music? 3. The episode of the good night kiss strikes some readers as odd or contradictory: the Narrator&#39;s need for a kiss seems almost infantile, while his power of observation seems extraordinarily precocious. Considering that he is sent to bed at eight o&#39;clock, how old do you think the Narrator is? Is it significant that his father suggests the Narrator be given the kiss he craves, whereas his mother is reluctant, saying &#39;We mustn&#39;t let the child get into the habit . . .&#39;? Is the fact that the Narrator succeeds in getting the kiss he wants a good thing or a bad thing? Why? 4. &#39;The whole of Proust&#39;s world comes out of a teacup,&#39; observed Samuel Beckett. Indeed the episode of the madeleine dipped in tea is the first (and most famous) of numerous instances of &#39;involuntary memory&#39; in the novel. A recognized psychological phenomenon triggered by smells, tastes, or sounds, involuntary memory vividly reproduces emotions, sensations, or images from the past. Why do you think readers and critics universally consider this scene to be pivotal? What does the Narrator think about the experience of involuntary memory? What might its function be in the scheme of In Search of Lost Time ? 5. Another emblematic theme involves the recurring &#39;little phrase&#39; of music by Vinteuil that catches the ear of Swann at the Verdurin&#39;s salon and steals into his life. How do Vinteuil&#39;s compositions stir both Swann and the Narrator? In Proust&#39;s scheme of things, is music a higher art than painting or writing because it can produce involuntary memories? How does involuntary memory affect writing and painting? Is it unrelated to art except as a necessary catalyst? 6. In &#39;Combray&#39; we are introduced to the Narrator&#39;s family, their household, and their country home. Since Paris is the true heart of upper-class France, why do you think Proust chose to begin In Search of Lost Time elsewhere? What do we learn from the Narrator&#39;s description of his family&#39;s life and habits? Is the household dominated by men or by women? Does the Narrator&#39;s account seem accurate, or is it colored by his own ideas and preoccupations? 7. A madeleine dipped into a cup of tea first impelled Proust into the &#39;remembrance of things past.&#39; Though Proust was a gourmet in his youth, in the final years of his life he subsisted mainly on fillets of sole, chicken, fried potatoes, ice cream, cakes, fruit, and iced beer. Consider how food and culinary happenings - from meals at the restaurant in the Grand Hotel in Balbec to dinners at La Raspeli�re and the Guermantes&#39;s in Paris - form an integral part of the work. 8. Swann&#39;s Way and the Guermantes Way are presented as mutually exclusive choices for promenades, with Swann&#39;s Way given primacy of place at the novel&#39;s outset. Where, metaphorically speaking, does Swann&#39;s Way seem to lead? What are the aesthetic signposts and milestones the Narrator points out? What does the landscape around Combray represent? 9. &#39;I want my work to be a sort of cathedral in literature,&#39; Proust once said. In his description of the area around Combray - and in many other places in the novel - the Narrator describes churches, and particularly steeples. Indeed, Howard Moss cites the steeple as one of Proust&#39;s most important symbols. In religious architecture, the steeple represents man&#39;s aspiration toward God, and by inference toward Art, the Proustian religion. What else might it suggest? Does it have a counterpart in nature? 10. Proust and the Narrator share an appreciation of gardens and flowers - Proust himself was eager to visit Monet&#39;s celebrated garden - and in a sense, all Combray can be seen as a garden. What associations does this evoke? How does the Narrator respond to natural beauty? What do flowers mean to him? How do we know? 11. Proust&#39;s work is filled with &#39;doubling&#39; - the most obvious being the identification of the author with a fictional self of the same name but with somewhat different characteristics. Is Swann a double of the Narrator? What qualities do they share? In what ways do they seem different? What is the importance of the fact that Swann is a Jew? 12. Louis Auchincloss questions the use of a fictional first person named &#39;Marcel,&#39; who is but isn&#39;t Proust. Marcel claims that he is neither a snob nor a homosexual, yet he is obsessed with both. Would Proust have strengthened Marcel&#39;s viewpoint by making it that of the young social climber that he himself so clearly was? Did he enhance or detract from Marcel&#39;s credibility by casting him as one of the few heterosexuals in the book? Does it matter that Marcel regards &#39;inversion&#39; as a dangerous vice? Did Proust? 13. &#39;Swann in Love&#39; might be thought of as a dress rehearsal for the Narrator&#39;s own performance, and Swann&#39;s passion for Odette establishes a model for various other love relationships that appear later in the book. Proust believed that all emotions and behavior obey certain psychological laws. E. M. Forster maintained that &#39;Proust&#39;s general theory of human intercourse is that the fonder we are of people the less we understand them - the theory of the complete pessimist.&#39; Do you agree? How does Swann&#39;s love affair reflect this? What conclusions does the Narrator draw from his perception of Swann&#39;s experience? In what way does this differ from Swann&#39;s own view? 14. The Balbec sequence of Within a Budding Grove gathers a group of the novel&#39;s principal characters, many for the first time: Robert de Saint-Loup, the Baron de Charlus, and Albertine, to name three of the most important. Others begin to emerge in their true significance, like Elstir the painter. Why do you think Proust chose to bring them together in Balbec? In what ways does Balbec echo or amplify Combray? Is the little &#39;society&#39; of Balbec a preview in microcosm of Paris? 15. While writing In Search of Lost Time Proust often rummaged through his vast photographic collection of Belle �poque luminaries as a means of stimulating his memory. &#39;You could see that his thoughts were following a kind of underground track, as if he were organizing everything into images before putting them into words,&#39; recalled his maid C�leste Albaret. Indeed, the Baron de Charlus, in Within a Budding Grove , speaks of the special importance of photographs in preserving an unsullied moment of time past, before it has been altered by the present. Discuss how Proust used photographs in the story - just as he exploited the technology of trains, cars, and airplanes - as symbols of passing time. 16. In his landmark essay on Proust, Edmund Wilson praises the broad Dickensian humor and extravagant satire that animate vast sections of In Search of Lost Time , yet he goes on to call it &#39;one of the gloomiest books ever written.&#39; Can you reconcile Wilson&#39;s remarks? 17. Critic Barbara Bucknall maintains that &#39;no Proustian lover really cares at all for his beloved&#39;s feelings.&#39; Is this true? Would the Narrator agree? Would the</p><p>First published in 1919, "Within a Budding Grove was awarded the Prix Goncourt, bringing the author immediate fame. In this second volume of "In Search of Lost Time, the narrator turns from the childhood reminiscences of "Swann's Way to memories of his adolescence.
